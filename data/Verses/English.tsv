Book	Chapter	Verse	Text
Zephaniah	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
Zephaniah	1	2	“I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord .
Zephaniah	1	3	“I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea— and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble.” “When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth,” declares the Lord ,
Zephaniah	1	4	“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—
Zephaniah	1	5	those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the Lord and who also swear by Molek,
Zephaniah	1	6	those who turn back from following the Lord and neither seek the Lord nor inquire of him.”
Zephaniah	1	7	Be silent before the Sovereign Lord , for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated those he has invited.
Zephaniah	1	8	“On the day of the Lord ’s sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king’s sons and all those clad in foreign clothes.
Zephaniah	1	9	On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah	1	10	“On that day,” declares the Lord , “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
Zephaniah	1	11	Wail, you who live in the market district ; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with silver will be destroyed.
Zephaniah	1	12	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, ‘The Lord will do nothing, either good or bad.’
Zephaniah	1	13	Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.”
Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of the Lord is near— near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry.
Zephaniah	1	15	That day will be a day of wrath— a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness—
Zephaniah	1	16	a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.
Zephaniah	1	17	“I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the Lord . Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung.
Zephaniah	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord ’s wrath.” In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth.
Zephaniah	2	1	Gather together, gather yourselves together, you shameful nation,
Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the Lord ’s fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the Lord ’s wrath comes upon you.
Zephaniah	2	3	Seek the Lord , all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord ’s anger.
Zephaniah	2	4	Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted.
Zephaniah	2	5	Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, “I will destroy you, and none will be left.”
Zephaniah	2	6	The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks.
Zephaniah	2	7	That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes.
Zephaniah	2	8	“I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land.
Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, “surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.”
Zephaniah	2	10	This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the Lord Almighty.
Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands.
Zephaniah	2	12	“You Cushites, too, will be slain by my sword.”
Zephaniah	2	13	He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert.
Zephaniah	2	14	Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed.
Zephaniah	2	15	This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, “I am the one! And there is none besides me.” What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.
Zephaniah	3	1	Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled!
Zephaniah	3	2	She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the Lord , she does not draw near to her God.
Zephaniah	3	3	Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning.
Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
Zephaniah	3	5	The Lord within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame.
Zephaniah	3	6	“I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty.
Zephaniah	3	7	Of Jerusalem I thought, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept correction!’ Then her place of refuge would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did.
Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore wait for me,” declares the Lord , “for the day I will stand up to testify. I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them— all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger.
Zephaniah	3	9	“Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him shoulder to shoulder.
Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings.
Zephaniah	3	11	On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill.
Zephaniah	3	12	But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the Lord .
Zephaniah	3	13	They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid.”
Zephaniah	3	14	Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
Zephaniah	3	15	The Lord has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The Lord , the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm.
Zephaniah	3	16	On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp.
Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.”
Zephaniah	3	18	“I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you.
Zephaniah	3	19	At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame.
Zephaniah	3	20	At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the Lord .
Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo:
Zechariah	1	2	“The Lord was very angry with your ancestors.
Zechariah	1	3	Therefore tell the people: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	1	4	Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the Lord .
Zechariah	1	5	Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
Zechariah	1	6	But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they repented and said, ‘The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ”
Zechariah	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.
Zechariah	1	8	During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.
Zechariah	1	9	I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”
Zechariah	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.”
Zechariah	1	11	And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.”
Zechariah	1	12	Then the angel of the Lord said, “ Lord Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?”
Zechariah	1	13	So the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
Zechariah	1	15	and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’
Zechariah	1	16	“Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	1	17	“Proclaim further: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ”
Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns.
Zechariah	1	19	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”
Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah	1	21	I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”
Zechariah	10	1	Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime; it is the Lord who sends the thunderstorms. He gives showers of rain to all people, and plants of the field to everyone.
Zechariah	10	2	The idols speak deceitfully, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
Zechariah	10	3	“My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the Lord Almighty will care for his flock, the people of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle.
Zechariah	10	4	From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler.
Zechariah	10	5	Together they will be like warriors in battle trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame.
Zechariah	10	6	“I will strengthen Judah and save the tribes of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the Lord their God and I will answer them.
Zechariah	10	7	The Ephraimites will become like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord .
Zechariah	10	8	I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before.
Zechariah	10	9	Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return.
Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them.
Zechariah	10	11	They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria’s pride will be brought down and Egypt’s scepter will pass away.
Zechariah	10	12	I will strengthen them in the Lord and in his name they will live securely,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	11	1	Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars!
Zechariah	11	2	Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has been cut down!
Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the wail of the shepherds; their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
Zechariah	11	4	This is what the Lord my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
Zechariah	11	5	Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the Lord , I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them.
Zechariah	11	6	For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the Lord . “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.”
Zechariah	11	7	So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock.
Zechariah	11	8	In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them
Zechariah	11	9	and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”
Zechariah	11	10	Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
Zechariah	11	11	It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the Lord .
Zechariah	11	12	I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
Zechariah	11	13	And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the Lord .
Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah	11	16	For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves.
Zechariah	11	17	“Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!”
Zechariah	12	1	A prophecy: The word of the Lord concerning Israel. The Lord , who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares:
Zechariah	12	2	“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.
Zechariah	12	3	On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves.
Zechariah	12	4	On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the Lord . “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations.
Zechariah	12	5	Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God.’
Zechariah	12	6	“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
Zechariah	12	7	“The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah.
Zechariah	12	8	On that day the Lord will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord going before them.
Zechariah	12	9	On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
Zechariah	12	10	“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.
Zechariah	12	11	On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah	12	12	The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,
Zechariah	12	13	the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,
Zechariah	12	14	and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
Zechariah	13	1	“On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
Zechariah	13	2	“On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
Zechariah	13	3	And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the Lord ’s name.’ Then their own parents will stab the one who prophesies.
Zechariah	13	4	“On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive.
Zechariah	13	5	Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth. ’
Zechariah	13	6	If someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body ?’ they will answer, ‘The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.’
Zechariah	13	7	“Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!” declares the Lord Almighty. “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
Zechariah	13	8	In the whole land,” declares the Lord , “two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
Zechariah	13	9	This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’ ”
Zechariah	14	1	A day of the Lord is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls.
Zechariah	14	2	I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle.
Zechariah	14	4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.
Zechariah	14	5	You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
Zechariah	14	6	On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness.
Zechariah	14	7	It will be a unique day—a day known only to the Lord —with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.
Zechariah	14	8	On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter.
Zechariah	14	9	The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord , and his name the only name.
Zechariah	14	10	The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place.
Zechariah	14	11	It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
Zechariah	14	12	This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
Zechariah	14	13	On that day people will be stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another.
Zechariah	14	14	Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing.
Zechariah	14	15	A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
Zechariah	14	16	Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	17	If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, they will have no rain.
Zechariah	14	18	If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The Lord will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	20	On that day Holy to the Lord will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the Lord ’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.
Zechariah	14	21	Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	2	1	Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah	2	2	I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”
Zechariah	2	3	While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him
Zechariah	2	4	and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it.
Zechariah	2	5	And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will be its glory within.’
Zechariah	2	6	“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the Lord , “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	2	7	“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!”
Zechariah	2	8	For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—
Zechariah	2	9	I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
Zechariah	2	10	“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	2	11	“Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah	2	12	The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah	2	13	Be still before the Lord , all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”
Zechariah	3	1	Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord , and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
Zechariah	3	2	The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord , who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”
Zechariah	3	3	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
Zechariah	3	4	The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”
Zechariah	3	5	Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.
Zechariah	3	6	The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:
Zechariah	3	7	“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.
Zechariah	3	8	“ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.
Zechariah	3	9	See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.
Zechariah	3	10	“ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
Zechariah	4	1	Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep.
Zechariah	4	2	He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps.
Zechariah	4	3	Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
Zechariah	4	4	I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah	4	5	He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied.
Zechariah	4	6	So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	4	7	“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”
Zechariah	4	8	Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Zechariah	4	9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah	4	10	“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone in the hand of Zerubbabel?”
Zechariah	4	11	Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
Zechariah	4	12	Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”
Zechariah	4	13	He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I said.
Zechariah	4	14	So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”
Zechariah	5	1	I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll.
Zechariah	5	2	He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. ”
Zechariah	5	3	And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished.
Zechariah	5	4	The Lord Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ”
Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”
Zechariah	5	6	I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land.”
Zechariah	5	7	Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
Zechariah	5	8	He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it.
Zechariah	5	9	Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
Zechariah	5	10	“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
Zechariah	5	11	He replied, “To the country of Babylonia to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”
Zechariah	6	1	I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
Zechariah	6	2	The first chariot had red horses, the second black,
Zechariah	6	3	the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful.
Zechariah	6	4	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah	6	5	The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.
Zechariah	6	6	The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”
Zechariah	6	7	When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.
Zechariah	6	8	Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.”
Zechariah	6	9	The word of the Lord came to me:
Zechariah	6	10	“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah	6	11	Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.
Zechariah	6	12	Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord .
Zechariah	6	13	It is he who will build the temple of the Lord , and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.’
Zechariah	6	14	The crown will be given to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the Lord .
Zechariah	6	15	Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord , and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.”
Zechariah	7	1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev.
Zechariah	7	2	The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the Lord
Zechariah	7	3	by asking the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
Zechariah	7	4	Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me:
Zechariah	7	5	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
Zechariah	7	6	And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves?
Zechariah	7	7	Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ”
Zechariah	7	8	And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah:
Zechariah	7	9	“This is what the Lord Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another.
Zechariah	7	10	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’
Zechariah	7	11	“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears.
Zechariah	7	12	They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
Zechariah	7	13	“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	7	14	‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ”
Zechariah	8	1	The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
Zechariah	8	2	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”
Zechariah	8	3	This is what the Lord says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.”
Zechariah	8	4	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.
Zechariah	8	5	The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
Zechariah	8	6	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	7	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.
Zechariah	8	8	I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”
Zechariah	8	9	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Now hear these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.’ This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	10	Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.
Zechariah	8	11	But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	12	“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.
Zechariah	8	13	Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.”
Zechariah	8	14	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,” says the Lord Almighty,
Zechariah	8	15	“so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
Zechariah	8	16	These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;
Zechariah	8	17	do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	8	18	The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
Zechariah	8	19	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.”
Zechariah	8	20	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come,
Zechariah	8	21	and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty. I myself am going.’
Zechariah	8	22	And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord Almighty and to entreat him.”
Zechariah	8	23	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’ ”
Zechariah	9	1	A prophecy: The word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrak and will come to rest on Damascus— for the eyes of all people and all the tribes of Israel are on the Lord —
Zechariah	9	2	and on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful.
Zechariah	9	3	Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
Zechariah	9	4	But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.
Zechariah	9	5	Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted.
Zechariah	9	6	A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod, and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah	9	7	I will take the blood from their mouths, the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
Zechariah	9	8	But I will encamp at my temple to guard it against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch.
Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
Zechariah	9	10	I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah	9	11	As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
Zechariah	9	12	Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
Zechariah	9	13	I will bend Judah as I bend my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and make you like a warrior’s sword.
Zechariah	9	14	Then the Lord will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south,
Zechariah	9	15	and the Lord Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
Zechariah	9	16	The Lord their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
Zechariah	9	17	How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—
Titus	1	2	in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,
Titus	1	3	and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
Titus	1	4	To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus	1	5	The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
Titus	1	6	An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
Titus	1	7	Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.
Titus	1	8	Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
Titus	1	9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
Titus	1	10	For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group.
Titus	1	11	They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
Titus	1	12	One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”
Titus	1	13	This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith
Titus	1	14	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth.
Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
Titus	1	16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
Titus	2	1	You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.
Titus	2	2	Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
Titus	2	3	Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
Titus	2	4	Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,
Titus	2	5	to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
Titus	2	6	Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
Titus	2	7	In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness
Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
Titus	2	9	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,
Titus	2	10	and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
Titus	2	12	It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
Titus	2	13	while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
Titus	2	15	These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
Titus	3	1	Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,
Titus	3	2	to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.
Titus	3	3	At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
Titus	3	5	he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus	3	7	so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
Titus	3	8	This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.
Titus	3	10	Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.
Titus	3	11	You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
Titus	3	12	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.
Titus	3	13	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
Titus	3	14	Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.
Titus	3	15	Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Zephaniah	1	1	The word of the Lord that came to Zephaniah son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, during the reign of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah:
Zephaniah	1	2	“I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord .
Zephaniah	1	3	“I will sweep away both man and beast; I will sweep away the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea— and the idols that cause the wicked to stumble.” “When I destroy all mankind on the face of the earth,” declares the Lord ,
Zephaniah	1	4	“I will stretch out my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem. I will destroy every remnant of Baal worship in this place, the very names of the idolatrous priests—
Zephaniah	1	5	those who bow down on the roofs to worship the starry host, those who bow down and swear by the Lord and who also swear by Molek,
Zephaniah	1	6	those who turn back from following the Lord and neither seek the Lord nor inquire of him.”
Zephaniah	1	7	Be silent before the Sovereign Lord , for the day of the Lord is near. The Lord has prepared a sacrifice; he has consecrated those he has invited.
Zephaniah	1	8	“On the day of the Lord ’s sacrifice I will punish the officials and the king’s sons and all those clad in foreign clothes.
Zephaniah	1	9	On that day I will punish all who avoid stepping on the threshold, who fill the temple of their gods with violence and deceit.
Zephaniah	1	10	“On that day,” declares the Lord , “a cry will go up from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New Quarter, and a loud crash from the hills.
Zephaniah	1	11	Wail, you who live in the market district ; all your merchants will be wiped out, all who trade with silver will be destroyed.
Zephaniah	1	12	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps and punish those who are complacent, who are like wine left on its dregs, who think, ‘The Lord will do nothing, either good or bad.’
Zephaniah	1	13	Their wealth will be plundered, their houses demolished. Though they build houses, they will not live in them; though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine.”
Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of the Lord is near— near and coming quickly. The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter; the Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry.
Zephaniah	1	15	That day will be a day of wrath— a day of distress and anguish, a day of trouble and ruin, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness—
Zephaniah	1	16	a day of trumpet and battle cry against the fortified cities and against the corner towers.
Zephaniah	1	17	“I will bring such distress on all people that they will grope about like those who are blind, because they have sinned against the Lord . Their blood will be poured out like dust and their entrails like dung.
Zephaniah	1	18	Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of the Lord ’s wrath.” In the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed, for he will make a sudden end of all who live on the earth.
Zephaniah	2	1	Gather together, gather yourselves together, you shameful nation,
Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree takes effect and that day passes like windblown chaff, before the Lord ’s fierce anger comes upon you, before the day of the Lord ’s wrath comes upon you.
Zephaniah	2	3	Seek the Lord , all you humble of the land, you who do what he commands. Seek righteousness, seek humility; perhaps you will be sheltered on the day of the Lord ’s anger.
Zephaniah	2	4	Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon left in ruins. At midday Ashdod will be emptied and Ekron uprooted.
Zephaniah	2	5	Woe to you who live by the sea, you Kerethite people; the word of the Lord is against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. He says, “I will destroy you, and none will be left.”
Zephaniah	2	6	The land by the sea will become pastures having wells for shepherds and pens for flocks.
Zephaniah	2	7	That land will belong to the remnant of the people of Judah; there they will find pasture. In the evening they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon. The Lord their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes.
Zephaniah	2	8	“I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land.
Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore, as surely as I live,” declares the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, “surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah— a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.”
Zephaniah	2	10	This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the Lord Almighty.
Zephaniah	2	11	The Lord will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the earth. Distant nations will bow down to him, all of them in their own lands.
Zephaniah	2	12	“You Cushites, too, will be slain by my sword.”
Zephaniah	2	13	He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert.
Zephaniah	2	14	Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their hooting will echo through the windows, rubble will fill the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed.
Zephaniah	2	15	This is the city of revelry that lived in safety. She said to herself, “I am the one! And there is none besides me.” What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.
Zephaniah	3	1	Woe to the city of oppressors, rebellious and defiled!
Zephaniah	3	2	She obeys no one, she accepts no correction. She does not trust in the Lord , she does not draw near to her God.
Zephaniah	3	3	Her officials within her are roaring lions; her rulers are evening wolves, who leave nothing for the morning.
Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are unprincipled; they are treacherous people. Her priests profane the sanctuary and do violence to the law.
Zephaniah	3	5	The Lord within her is righteous; he does no wrong. Morning by morning he dispenses his justice, and every new day he does not fail, yet the unrighteous know no shame.
Zephaniah	3	6	“I have destroyed nations; their strongholds are demolished. I have left their streets deserted, with no one passing through. Their cities are laid waste; they are deserted and empty.
Zephaniah	3	7	Of Jerusalem I thought, ‘Surely you will fear me and accept correction!’ Then her place of refuge would not be destroyed, nor all my punishments come upon her. But they were still eager to act corruptly in all they did.
Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore wait for me,” declares the Lord , “for the day I will stand up to testify. I have decided to assemble the nations, to gather the kingdoms and to pour out my wrath on them— all my fierce anger. The whole world will be consumed by the fire of my jealous anger.
Zephaniah	3	9	“Then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him shoulder to shoulder.
Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers, my scattered people, will bring me offerings.
Zephaniah	3	11	On that day you, Jerusalem, will not be put to shame for all the wrongs you have done to me, because I will remove from you your arrogant boasters. Never again will you be haughty on my holy hill.
Zephaniah	3	12	But I will leave within you the meek and humble. The remnant of Israel will trust in the name of the Lord .
Zephaniah	3	13	They will do no wrong; they will tell no lies. A deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. They will eat and lie down and no one will make them afraid.”
Zephaniah	3	14	Sing, Daughter Zion; shout aloud, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem!
Zephaniah	3	15	The Lord has taken away your punishment, he has turned back your enemy. The Lord , the King of Israel, is with you; never again will you fear any harm.
Zephaniah	3	16	On that day they will say to Jerusalem, “Do not fear, Zion; do not let your hands hang limp.
Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.”
Zephaniah	3	18	“I will remove from you all who mourn over the loss of your appointed festivals, which is a burden and reproach for you.
Zephaniah	3	19	At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you. I will rescue the lame; I will gather the exiles. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have suffered shame.
Zephaniah	3	20	At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,” says the Lord .
Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo:
Zechariah	1	2	“The Lord was very angry with your ancestors.
Zechariah	1	3	Therefore tell the people: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	1	4	Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the Lord .
Zechariah	1	5	Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever?
Zechariah	1	6	But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? “Then they repented and said, ‘The Lord Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ”
Zechariah	1	7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo.
Zechariah	1	8	During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses.
Zechariah	1	9	I asked, “What are these, my lord?” The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.”
Zechariah	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the Lord has sent to go throughout the earth.”
Zechariah	1	11	And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.”
Zechariah	1	12	Then the angel of the Lord said, “ Lord Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?”
Zechariah	1	13	So the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,
Zechariah	1	15	and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’
Zechariah	1	16	“Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	1	17	“Proclaim further: This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ”
Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns.
Zechariah	1	19	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.”
Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen.
Zechariah	1	21	I asked, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”
Zechariah	10	1	Ask the Lord for rain in the springtime; it is the Lord who sends the thunderstorms. He gives showers of rain to all people, and plants of the field to everyone.
Zechariah	10	2	The idols speak deceitfully, diviners see visions that lie; they tell dreams that are false, they give comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd.
Zechariah	10	3	“My anger burns against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the Lord Almighty will care for his flock, the people of Judah, and make them like a proud horse in battle.
Zechariah	10	4	From Judah will come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler.
Zechariah	10	5	Together they will be like warriors in battle trampling their enemy into the mud of the streets. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and they will put the enemy horsemen to shame.
Zechariah	10	6	“I will strengthen Judah and save the tribes of Joseph. I will restore them because I have compassion on them. They will be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the Lord their God and I will answer them.
Zechariah	10	7	The Ephraimites will become like warriors, and their hearts will be glad as with wine. Their children will see it and be joyful; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord .
Zechariah	10	8	I will signal for them and gather them in. Surely I will redeem them; they will be as numerous as before.
Zechariah	10	9	Though I scatter them among the peoples, yet in distant lands they will remember me. They and their children will survive, and they will return.
Zechariah	10	10	I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will bring them to Gilead and Lebanon, and there will not be room enough for them.
Zechariah	10	11	They will pass through the sea of trouble; the surging sea will be subdued and all the depths of the Nile will dry up. Assyria’s pride will be brought down and Egypt’s scepter will pass away.
Zechariah	10	12	I will strengthen them in the Lord and in his name they will live securely,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	11	1	Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedars!
Zechariah	11	2	Wail, you juniper, for the cedar has fallen; the stately trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan; the dense forest has been cut down!
Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the wail of the shepherds; their rich pastures are destroyed! Listen to the roar of the lions; the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined!
Zechariah	11	4	This is what the Lord my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
Zechariah	11	5	Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the Lord , I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them.
Zechariah	11	6	For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the Lord . “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.”
Zechariah	11	7	So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock.
Zechariah	11	8	In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them
Zechariah	11	9	and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”
Zechariah	11	10	Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations.
Zechariah	11	11	It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the Lord .
Zechariah	11	12	I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver.
Zechariah	11	13	And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the Lord .
Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel.
Zechariah	11	15	Then the Lord said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
Zechariah	11	16	For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves.
Zechariah	11	17	“Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! May his arm be completely withered, his right eye totally blinded!”
Zechariah	12	1	A prophecy: The word of the Lord concerning Israel. The Lord , who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares:
Zechariah	12	2	“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem.
Zechariah	12	3	On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves.
Zechariah	12	4	On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the Lord . “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations.
Zechariah	12	5	Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the Lord Almighty is their God.’
Zechariah	12	6	“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place.
Zechariah	12	7	“The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah.
Zechariah	12	8	On that day the Lord will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord going before them.
Zechariah	12	9	On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem.
Zechariah	12	10	“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.
Zechariah	12	11	On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.
Zechariah	12	12	The land will mourn, each clan by itself, with their wives by themselves: the clan of the house of David and their wives, the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives,
Zechariah	12	13	the clan of the house of Levi and their wives, the clan of Shimei and their wives,
Zechariah	12	14	and all the rest of the clans and their wives.
Zechariah	13	1	“On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
Zechariah	13	2	“On that day, I will banish the names of the idols from the land, and they will be remembered no more,” declares the Lord Almighty. “I will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land.
Zechariah	13	3	And if anyone still prophesies, their father and mother, to whom they were born, will say to them, ‘You must die, because you have told lies in the Lord ’s name.’ Then their own parents will stab the one who prophesies.
Zechariah	13	4	“On that day every prophet will be ashamed of their prophetic vision. They will not put on a prophet’s garment of hair in order to deceive.
Zechariah	13	5	Each will say, ‘I am not a prophet. I am a farmer; the land has been my livelihood since my youth. ’
Zechariah	13	6	If someone asks, ‘What are these wounds on your body ?’ they will answer, ‘The wounds I was given at the house of my friends.’
Zechariah	13	7	“Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me!” declares the Lord Almighty. “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn my hand against the little ones.
Zechariah	13	8	In the whole land,” declares the Lord , “two-thirds will be struck down and perish; yet one-third will be left in it.
Zechariah	13	9	This third I will put into the fire; I will refine them like silver and test them like gold. They will call on my name and I will answer them; I will say, ‘They are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is our God.’ ”
Zechariah	14	1	A day of the Lord is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls.
Zechariah	14	2	I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city.
Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle.
Zechariah	14	4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south.
Zechariah	14	5	You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him.
Zechariah	14	6	On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness.
Zechariah	14	7	It will be a unique day—a day known only to the Lord —with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.
Zechariah	14	8	On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter.
Zechariah	14	9	The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one Lord , and his name the only name.
Zechariah	14	10	The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place.
Zechariah	14	11	It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure.
Zechariah	14	12	This is the plague with which the Lord will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.
Zechariah	14	13	On that day people will be stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another.
Zechariah	14	14	Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing.
Zechariah	14	15	A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.
Zechariah	14	16	Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	17	If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord Almighty, they will have no rain.
Zechariah	14	18	If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The Lord will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.
Zechariah	14	20	On that day Holy to the Lord will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the Lord ’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar.
Zechariah	14	21	Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	2	1	Then I looked up, and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand.
Zechariah	2	2	I asked, “Where are you going?” He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem, to find out how wide and how long it is.”
Zechariah	2	3	While the angel who was speaking to me was leaving, another angel came to meet him
Zechariah	2	4	and said to him: “Run, tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of people and animals in it.
Zechariah	2	5	And I myself will be a wall of fire around it,’ declares the Lord , ‘and I will be its glory within.’
Zechariah	2	6	“Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the Lord , “for I have scattered you to the four winds of heaven,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	2	7	“Come, Zion! Escape, you who live in Daughter Babylon!”
Zechariah	2	8	For this is what the Lord Almighty says: “After the Glorious One has sent me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye—
Zechariah	2	9	I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.
Zechariah	2	10	“Shout and be glad, Daughter Zion. For I am coming, and I will live among you,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	2	11	“Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day and will become my people. I will live among you and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah	2	12	The Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose Jerusalem.
Zechariah	2	13	Be still before the Lord , all mankind, because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.”
Zechariah	3	1	Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord , and Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.
Zechariah	3	2	The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord , who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?”
Zechariah	3	3	Now Joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel.
Zechariah	3	4	The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Take off his filthy clothes.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you.”
Zechariah	3	5	Then I said, “Put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.
Zechariah	3	6	The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:
Zechariah	3	7	“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.
Zechariah	3	8	“ ‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.
Zechariah	3	9	See, the stone I have set in front of Joshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord Almighty, ‘and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.
Zechariah	3	10	“ ‘In that day each of you will invite your neighbor to sit under your vine and fig tree,’ declares the Lord Almighty.”
Zechariah	4	1	Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep.
Zechariah	4	2	He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps.
Zechariah	4	3	Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
Zechariah	4	4	I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah	4	5	He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I replied.
Zechariah	4	6	So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	4	7	“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ”
Zechariah	4	8	Then the word of the Lord came to me:
Zechariah	4	9	“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.
Zechariah	4	10	“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the Lord that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone in the hand of Zerubbabel?”
Zechariah	4	11	Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
Zechariah	4	12	Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?”
Zechariah	4	13	He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” “No, my lord,” I said.
Zechariah	4	14	So he said, “These are the two who are anointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”
Zechariah	5	1	I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll.
Zechariah	5	2	He asked me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. ”
Zechariah	5	3	And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished.
Zechariah	5	4	The Lord Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ”
Zechariah	5	5	Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.”
Zechariah	5	6	I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity of the people throughout the land.”
Zechariah	5	7	Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman!
Zechariah	5	8	He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it.
Zechariah	5	9	Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth.
Zechariah	5	10	“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me.
Zechariah	5	11	He replied, “To the country of Babylonia to build a house for it. When the house is ready, the basket will be set there in its place.”
Zechariah	6	1	I looked up again, and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains—mountains of bronze.
Zechariah	6	2	The first chariot had red horses, the second black,
Zechariah	6	3	the third white, and the fourth dappled—all of them powerful.
Zechariah	6	4	I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these, my lord?”
Zechariah	6	5	The angel answered me, “These are the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world.
Zechariah	6	6	The one with the black horses is going toward the north country, the one with the white horses toward the west, and the one with the dappled horses toward the south.”
Zechariah	6	7	When the powerful horses went out, they were straining to go throughout the earth. And he said, “Go throughout the earth!” So they went throughout the earth.
Zechariah	6	8	Then he called to me, “Look, those going toward the north country have given my Spirit rest in the land of the north.”
Zechariah	6	9	The word of the Lord came to me:
Zechariah	6	10	“Take silver and gold from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon. Go the same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah.
Zechariah	6	11	Take the silver and gold and make a crown, and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jozadak.
Zechariah	6	12	Tell him this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Here is the man whose name is the Branch, and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the Lord .
Zechariah	6	13	It is he who will build the temple of the Lord , and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne. And he will be a priest on his throne. And there will be harmony between the two.’
Zechariah	6	14	The crown will be given to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen son of Zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the Lord .
Zechariah	6	15	Those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the Lord , and you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you. This will happen if you diligently obey the Lord your God.”
Zechariah	7	1	In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev.
Zechariah	7	2	The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the Lord
Zechariah	7	3	by asking the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
Zechariah	7	4	Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me:
Zechariah	7	5	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted?
Zechariah	7	6	And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves?
Zechariah	7	7	Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ”
Zechariah	7	8	And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah:
Zechariah	7	9	“This is what the Lord Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another.
Zechariah	7	10	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’
Zechariah	7	11	“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears.
Zechariah	7	12	They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the Lord Almighty was very angry.
Zechariah	7	13	“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	7	14	‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ”
Zechariah	8	1	The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
Zechariah	8	2	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I am very jealous for Zion; I am burning with jealousy for her.”
Zechariah	8	3	This is what the Lord says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty will be called the Holy Mountain.”
Zechariah	8	4	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each of them with cane in hand because of their age.
Zechariah	8	5	The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”
Zechariah	8	6	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?” declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	7	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “I will save my people from the countries of the east and the west.
Zechariah	8	8	I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be faithful and righteous to them as their God.”
Zechariah	8	9	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Now hear these words, ‘Let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built.’ This is also what the prophets said who were present when the foundation was laid for the house of the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	10	Before that time there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, since I had turned everyone against their neighbor.
Zechariah	8	11	But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as I did in the past,” declares the Lord Almighty.
Zechariah	8	12	“The seed will grow well, the vine will yield its fruit, the ground will produce its crops, and the heavens will drop their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.
Zechariah	8	13	Just as you, Judah and Israel, have been a curse among the nations, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid, but let your hands be strong.”
Zechariah	8	14	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster on you and showed no pity when your ancestors angered me,” says the Lord Almighty,
Zechariah	8	15	“so now I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid.
Zechariah	8	16	These are the things you are to do: Speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgment in your courts;
Zechariah	8	17	do not plot evil against each other, and do not love to swear falsely. I hate all this,” declares the Lord .
Zechariah	8	18	The word of the Lord Almighty came to me.
Zechariah	8	19	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace.”
Zechariah	8	20	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come,
Zechariah	8	21	and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the Lord and seek the Lord Almighty. I myself am going.’
Zechariah	8	22	And many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord Almighty and to entreat him.”
Zechariah	8	23	This is what the Lord Almighty says: “In those days ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his robe and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’ ”
Zechariah	9	1	A prophecy: The word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrak and will come to rest on Damascus— for the eyes of all people and all the tribes of Israel are on the Lord —
Zechariah	9	2	and on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on Tyre and Sidon, though they are very skillful.
Zechariah	9	3	Tyre has built herself a stronghold; she has heaped up silver like dust, and gold like the dirt of the streets.
Zechariah	9	4	But the Lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.
Zechariah	9	5	Ashkelon will see it and fear; Gaza will writhe in agony, and Ekron too, for her hope will wither. Gaza will lose her king and Ashkelon will be deserted.
Zechariah	9	6	A mongrel people will occupy Ashdod, and I will put an end to the pride of the Philistines.
Zechariah	9	7	I will take the blood from their mouths, the forbidden food from between their teeth. Those who are left will belong to our God and become a clan in Judah, and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.
Zechariah	9	8	But I will encamp at my temple to guard it against marauding forces. Never again will an oppressor overrun my people, for now I am keeping watch.
Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
Zechariah	9	10	I will take away the chariots from Ephraim and the warhorses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow will be broken. He will proclaim peace to the nations. His rule will extend from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Zechariah	9	11	As for you, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will free your prisoners from the waterless pit.
Zechariah	9	12	Return to your fortress, you prisoners of hope; even now I announce that I will restore twice as much to you.
Zechariah	9	13	I will bend Judah as I bend my bow and fill it with Ephraim. I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and make you like a warrior’s sword.
Zechariah	9	14	Then the Lord will appear over them; his arrow will flash like lightning. The Sovereign Lord will sound the trumpet; he will march in the storms of the south,
Zechariah	9	15	and the Lord Almighty will shield them. They will destroy and overcome with slingstones. They will drink and roar as with wine; they will be full like a bowl used for sprinkling the corners of the altar.
Zechariah	9	16	The Lord their God will save his people on that day as a shepherd saves his flock. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
Zechariah	9	17	How attractive and beautiful they will be! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the young women.
Titus	1	1	Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ to further the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—
Titus	1	2	in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,
Titus	1	3	and which now at his appointed season he has brought to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
Titus	1	4	To Titus, my true son in our common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
Titus	1	5	The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
Titus	1	6	An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
Titus	1	7	Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.
Titus	1	8	Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
Titus	1	9	He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
Titus	1	10	For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group.
Titus	1	11	They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
Titus	1	12	One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”
Titus	1	13	This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith
Titus	1	14	and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth.
Titus	1	15	To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
Titus	1	16	They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
Titus	2	1	You, however, must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine.
Titus	2	2	Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
Titus	2	3	Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
Titus	2	4	Then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children,
Titus	2	5	to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
Titus	2	6	Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
Titus	2	7	In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness
Titus	2	8	and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
Titus	2	9	Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,
Titus	2	10	and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
Titus	2	11	For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people.
Titus	2	12	It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
Titus	2	13	while we wait for the blessed hope—the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
Titus	2	14	who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
Titus	2	15	These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
Titus	3	1	Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,
Titus	3	2	to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.
Titus	3	3	At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
Titus	3	4	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
Titus	3	5	he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
Titus	3	6	whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
Titus	3	7	so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
Titus	3	8	This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.
Titus	3	10	Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing to do with them.
Titus	3	11	You may be sure that such people are warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
Titus	3	12	As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.
Titus	3	13	Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
Titus	3	14	Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order to provide for urgent needs and not live unproductive lives.
Titus	3	15	Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
Song of Songs	1	1	Solomon’s Song of Songs.
Song of Songs	1	2	Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth— for your love is more delightful than wine.
Song of Songs	1	3	Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the young women love you!
Song of Songs	1	4	Take me away with you—let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you ; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!
Song of Songs	1	5	Dark am I, yet lovely, daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.
Song of Songs	1	6	Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother’s sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I had to neglect.
Song of Songs	1	7	Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?
Song of Songs	1	8	If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
Song of Songs	1	9	I liken you, my darling, to a mare among Pharaoh’s chariot horses.
Song of Songs	1	10	Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.
Song of Songs	1	11	We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.
Song of Songs	1	12	While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
Song of Songs	1	13	My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
Song of Songs	1	14	My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
Song of Songs	1	15	How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
Song of Songs	1	16	How handsome you are, my beloved! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.
Song of Songs	1	17	The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.
Song of Songs	2	1	I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
Song of Songs	2	2	Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the young women.
Song of Songs	2	3	Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
Song of Songs	2	4	Let him lead me to the banquet hall, and let his banner over me be love.
Song of Songs	2	5	Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
Song of Songs	2	6	His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
Song of Songs	2	7	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Song of Songs	2	8	Listen! My beloved! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.
Song of Songs	2	9	My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
Song of Songs	2	10	My beloved spoke and said to me, “Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, come with me.
Song of Songs	2	11	See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.
Song of Songs	2	12	Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
Song of Songs	2	13	The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me.”
Song of Songs	2	14	My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
Song of Songs	2	15	Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.
Song of Songs	2	16	My beloved is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.
Song of Songs	2	17	Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.
Song of Songs	3	1	All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him.
Song of Songs	3	2	I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him.
Song of Songs	3	3	The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. “Have you seen the one my heart loves?”
Song of Songs	3	4	Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the room of the one who conceived me.
Song of Songs	3	5	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Song of Songs	3	6	Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?
Song of Songs	3	7	Look! It is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,
Song of Songs	3	8	all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night.
Song of Songs	3	9	King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon.
Song of Songs	3	10	Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior inlaid with love. Daughters of Jerusalem,
Song of Songs	3	11	come out, and look, you daughters of Zion. Look on King Solomon wearing a crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.
Song of Songs	4	1	How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from the hills of Gilead.
Song of Songs	4	2	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, coming up from the washing. Each has its twin; not one of them is alone.
Song of Songs	4	3	Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
Song of Songs	4	4	Your neck is like the tower of David, built with courses of stone ; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
Song of Songs	4	5	Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.
Song of Songs	4	6	Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.
Song of Songs	4	7	You are altogether beautiful, my darling; there is no flaw in you.
Song of Songs	4	8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the lions’ dens and the mountain haunts of leopards.
Song of Songs	4	9	You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
Song of Songs	4	10	How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume more than any spice!
Song of Songs	4	11	Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
Song of Songs	4	12	You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
Song of Songs	4	13	Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,
Song of Songs	4	14	nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices.
Song of Songs	4	15	You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
Song of Songs	4	16	Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread everywhere. Let my beloved come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
Song of Songs	5	1	I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends, and drink; drink your fill of love.
Song of Songs	5	2	I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”
Song of Songs	5	3	I have taken off my robe— must I put it on again? I have washed my feet— must I soil them again?
Song of Songs	5	4	My beloved thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.
Song of Songs	5	5	I arose to open for my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.
Song of Songs	5	6	I opened for my beloved, but my beloved had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.
Song of Songs	5	7	The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!
Song of Songs	5	8	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you— if you find my beloved, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.
Song of Songs	5	9	How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you so charge us?
Song of Songs	5	10	My beloved is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.
Song of Songs	5	11	His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
Song of Songs	5	12	His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.
Song of Songs	5	13	His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.
Song of Songs	5	14	His arms are rods of gold set with topaz. His body is like polished ivory decorated with lapis lazuli.
Song of Songs	5	15	His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
Song of Songs	5	16	His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
Song of Songs	6	1	Where has your beloved gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your beloved turn, that we may look for him with you?
Song of Songs	6	2	My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.
Song of Songs	6	3	I am my beloved’s and my beloved is mine; he browses among the lilies.
Song of Songs	6	4	You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.
Song of Songs	6	5	Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.
Song of Songs	6	6	Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is missing.
Song of Songs	6	7	Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
Song of Songs	6	8	Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number;
Song of Songs	6	9	but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.
Song of Songs	6	10	Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?
Song of Songs	6	11	I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.
Song of Songs	6	12	Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
Song of Songs	6	13	Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you! Why would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?
Song of Songs	7	1	How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince’s daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of an artist’s hands.
Song of Songs	7	2	Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
Song of Songs	7	3	Your breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle.
Song of Songs	7	4	Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
Song of Songs	7	5	Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses.
Song of Songs	7	6	How beautiful you are and how pleasing, my love, with your delights!
Song of Songs	7	7	Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
Song of Songs	7	8	I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of grapes on the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,
Song of Songs	7	9	and your mouth like the best wine. May the wine go straight to my beloved, flowing gently over lips and teeth.
Song of Songs	7	10	I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.
Song of Songs	7	11	Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages.
Song of Songs	7	12	Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom— there I will give you my love.
Song of Songs	7	13	The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my beloved.
Song of Songs	8	1	If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother’s breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
Song of Songs	8	2	I would lead you and bring you to my mother’s house— she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
Song of Songs	8	3	His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
Song of Songs	8	4	Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you: Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
Song of Songs	8	5	Who is this coming up from the wilderness leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.
Song of Songs	8	6	Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.
Song of Songs	8	7	Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If one were to give all the wealth of one’s house for love, it would be utterly scorned.
Song of Songs	8	8	We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
Song of Songs	8	9	If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
Song of Songs	8	10	I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.
Song of Songs	8	11	Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.
Song of Songs	8	12	But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
Song of Songs	8	13	You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!
Song of Songs	8	14	Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.
Ruth	1	1	In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
Ruth	1	2	The man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
Ruth	1	3	Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
Ruth	1	4	They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
Ruth	1	5	both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
Ruth	1	6	When Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
Ruth	1	7	With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
Ruth	1	8	Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the Lord show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me.
Ruth	1	9	May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.” Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud
Ruth	1	10	and said to her, “We will go back with you to your people.”
Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?
Ruth	1	12	Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons—
Ruth	1	13	would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord ’s hand has turned against me!”
Ruth	1	14	At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.
Ruth	1	15	“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”
Ruth	1	16	But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
Ruth	1	17	Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.”
Ruth	1	18	When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
Ruth	1	19	So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?”
Ruth	1	20	“Don’t call me Naomi, ” she told them. “Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
Ruth	1	21	I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.”
Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
Ruth	2	1	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz.
Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.”
Ruth	2	3	So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.
Ruth	2	4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The Lord be with you!” “The Lord bless you!” they answered.
Ruth	2	5	Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?”
Ruth	2	6	The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi.
Ruth	2	7	She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.”
Ruth	2	8	So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me.
Ruth	2	9	Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.”
Ruth	2	10	At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?”
Ruth	2	11	Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
Ruth	2	12	May the Lord repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the Lord , the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”
Ruth	2	13	“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.”
Ruth	2	14	At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.” When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
Ruth	2	15	As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her.
Ruth	2	16	Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.”
Ruth	2	17	So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
Ruth	2	18	She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!” Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said.
Ruth	2	20	“The Lord bless him!” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. “He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.” She added, “That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers. ”
Ruth	2	21	Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’ ”
Ruth	2	22	Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.”
Ruth	2	23	So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
Ruth	3	1	One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home for you, where you will be well provided for.
Ruth	3	2	Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
Ruth	3	3	Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
Ruth	3	4	When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.”
Ruth	3	5	“I will do whatever you say,” Ruth answered.
Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.
Ruth	3	8	In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet!
Ruth	3	9	“Who are you?” he asked. “I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer of our family.”
Ruth	3	10	“The Lord bless you, my daughter,” he replied. “This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
Ruth	3	11	And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.
Ruth	3	12	Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I.
Ruth	3	13	Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.”
Ruth	3	14	So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.”
Ruth	3	15	He also said, “Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he went back to town.
Ruth	3	16	When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?” Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her
Ruth	3	17	and added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ”
Ruth	3	18	Then Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.”
Ruth	4	1	Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there just as the guardian-redeemer he had mentioned came along. Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.
Ruth	4	2	Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, “Sit here,” and they did so.
Ruth	4	3	Then he said to the guardian-redeemer, “Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek.
Ruth	4	4	I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line.” “I will redeem it,” he said.
Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabite, the dead man’s widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property.”
Ruth	4	6	At this, the guardian-redeemer said, “Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it.”
Ruth	4	7	(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)
Ruth	4	8	So the guardian-redeemer said to Boaz, “Buy it yourself.” And he removed his sandal.
Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelek, Kilion and Mahlon.
Ruth	4	10	I have also acquired Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. Today you are witnesses!”
Ruth	4	11	Then the elders and all the people at the gate said, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the family of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
Ruth	4	12	Through the offspring the Lord gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”
Ruth	4	13	So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi: “Praise be to the Lord , who this day has not left you without a guardian-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!
Ruth	4	15	He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.”
Ruth	4	16	Then Naomi took the child in her arms and cared for him.
Ruth	4	17	The women living there said, “Naomi has a son!” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
Ruth	4	18	This, then, is the family line of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,
Ruth	4	19	Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,
Ruth	4	20	Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
Ruth	4	21	Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,
Ruth	4	22	Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
Romans	1	1	Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God—
Romans	1	2	the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
Romans	1	3	regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life was a descendant of David,
Romans	1	4	and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans	1	5	Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his name’s sake.
Romans	1	6	And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
Romans	1	7	To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be his holy people: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	1	8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.
Romans	1	9	God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you
Romans	1	10	in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
Romans	1	11	I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong—
Romans	1	12	that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.
Romans	1	13	I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
Romans	1	14	I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
Romans	1	15	That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.
Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
Romans	1	17	For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”
Romans	1	18	The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
Romans	1	19	since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
Romans	1	20	For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
Romans	1	21	For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Romans	1	22	Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
Romans	1	24	Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
Romans	1	25	They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
Romans	1	26	Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones.
Romans	1	27	In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.
Romans	1	28	Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.
Romans	1	29	They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
Romans	1	30	slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
Romans	1	31	they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.
Romans	1	32	Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
Romans	10	1	Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
Romans	10	2	For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
Romans	10	3	Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.
Romans	10	4	Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
Romans	10	5	Moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”
Romans	10	6	But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down)
Romans	10	7	“or ‘Who will descend into the deep?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
Romans	10	8	But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim:
Romans	10	9	If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Romans	10	10	For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.
Romans	10	11	As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,
Romans	10	13	for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
Romans	10	14	How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
Romans	10	15	And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”
Romans	10	16	But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our message?”
Romans	10	17	Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ.
Romans	10	18	But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: “Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”
Romans	10	19	Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”
Romans	10	20	And Isaiah boldly says, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”
Romans	10	21	But concerning Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.”
Romans	11	1	I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
Romans	11	2	God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel:
Romans	11	3	“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me” ?
Romans	11	4	And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”
Romans	11	5	So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
Romans	11	6	And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.
Romans	11	7	What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened,
Romans	11	8	as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”
Romans	11	9	And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
Romans	11	10	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”
Romans	11	11	Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
Romans	11	12	But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!
Romans	11	13	I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry
Romans	11	14	in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
Romans	11	15	For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
Romans	11	16	If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
Romans	11	17	If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
Romans	11	18	do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
Romans	11	19	You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”
Romans	11	20	Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble.
Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
Romans	11	22	Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
Romans	11	23	And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
Romans	11	24	After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
Romans	11	25	I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,
Romans	11	26	and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: “The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
Romans	11	27	And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”
Romans	11	28	As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
Romans	11	29	for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable.
Romans	11	30	Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
Romans	11	31	so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you.
Romans	11	32	For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
Romans	11	33	Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
Romans	11	34	“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”
Romans	11	35	“Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?”
Romans	11	36	For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
Romans	12	1	Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship.
Romans	12	2	Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.
Romans	12	3	For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you.
Romans	12	4	For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,
Romans	12	5	so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.
Romans	12	6	We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;
Romans	12	7	if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;
Romans	12	8	if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.
Romans	12	9	Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
Romans	12	10	Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.
Romans	12	11	Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
Romans	12	12	Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
Romans	12	13	Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
Romans	12	14	Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
Romans	12	16	Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.
Romans	12	17	Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone.
Romans	12	18	If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
Romans	12	19	Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord.
Romans	12	20	On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”
Romans	12	21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans	13	1	Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
Romans	13	2	Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
Romans	13	3	For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.
Romans	13	4	For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
Romans	13	5	Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
Romans	13	6	This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants, who give their full time to governing.
Romans	13	7	Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
Romans	13	8	Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law.
Romans	13	9	The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other command there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”
Romans	13	10	Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
Romans	13	11	And do this, understanding the present time: The hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans	13	12	The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
Romans	13	13	Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
Romans	13	14	Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
Romans	14	1	Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters.
Romans	14	2	One person’s faith allows them to eat anything, but another, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.
Romans	14	3	The one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted them.
Romans	14	4	Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.
Romans	14	5	One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind.
Romans	14	6	Whoever regards one day as special does so to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
Romans	14	7	For none of us lives for ourselves alone, and none of us dies for ourselves alone.
Romans	14	8	If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
Romans	14	9	For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
Romans	14	10	You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister ? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.
Romans	14	11	It is written: “ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.’ ”
Romans	14	12	So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
Romans	14	13	Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.
Romans	14	14	I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.
Romans	14	15	If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy someone for whom Christ died.
Romans	14	16	Therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil.
Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,
Romans	14	18	because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.
Romans	14	19	Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
Romans	14	20	Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
Romans	14	21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.
Romans	14	22	So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
Romans	14	23	But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
Romans	15	1	We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
Romans	15	2	Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up.
Romans	15	3	For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”
Romans	15	4	For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.
Romans	15	5	May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had,
Romans	15	6	so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Romans	15	7	Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.
Romans	15	8	For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed
Romans	15	9	and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing the praises of your name.”
Romans	15	10	Again, it says, “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.”
Romans	15	11	And again, “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol him.”
Romans	15	12	And again, Isaiah says, “The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope.”
Romans	15	13	May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Romans	15	14	I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
Romans	15	15	Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me
Romans	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Romans	15	17	Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
Romans	15	18	I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done—
Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
Romans	15	20	It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.
Romans	15	21	Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”
Romans	15	22	This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
Romans	15	23	But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you,
Romans	15	24	I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.
Romans	15	25	Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there.
Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem.
Romans	15	27	They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
Romans	15	28	So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
Romans	15	29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
Romans	15	30	I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
Romans	15	31	Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there,
Romans	15	32	so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed.
Romans	15	33	The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
Romans	16	1	I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a deacon of the church in Cenchreae.
Romans	16	2	I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of his people and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been the benefactor of many people, including me.
Romans	16	3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in Christ Jesus.
Romans	16	4	They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
Romans	16	5	Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
Romans	16	6	Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
Romans	16	7	Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
Romans	16	8	Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
Romans	16	9	Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
Romans	16	10	Greet Apelles, whose fidelity to Christ has stood the test. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
Romans	16	11	Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
Romans	16	12	Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
Romans	16	13	Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
Romans	16	14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the other brothers and sisters with them.
Romans	16	15	Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the Lord’s people who are with them.
Romans	16	16	Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
Romans	16	17	I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
Romans	16	18	For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
Romans	16	19	Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I rejoice because of you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
Romans	16	20	The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
Romans	16	21	Timothy, my co-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
Romans	16	22	I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
Romans	16	23	Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city’s director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.
Romans	16	25	Now to him who is able to establish you in accordance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
Romans	16	26	but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come to the obedience that comes from faith—
Romans	16	27	to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
Romans	2	1	You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
Romans	2	2	Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
Romans	2	3	So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?
Romans	2	4	Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
Romans	2	5	But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.
Romans	2	6	God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”
Romans	2	7	To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
Romans	2	8	But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
Romans	2	9	There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
Romans	2	10	but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
Romans	2	11	For God does not show favoritism.
Romans	2	12	All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
Romans	2	13	For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
Romans	2	14	(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.
Romans	2	15	They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.)
Romans	2	16	This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
Romans	2	17	Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;
Romans	2	18	if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;
Romans	2	19	if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,
Romans	2	20	an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—
Romans	2	21	you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
Romans	2	22	You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
Romans	2	23	You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
Romans	2	24	As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”
Romans	2	25	Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
Romans	2	26	So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
Romans	2	27	The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
Romans	2	28	A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
Romans	2	29	No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God.
Romans	3	1	What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?
Romans	3	2	Much in every way! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the very words of God.
Romans	3	3	What if some were unfaithful? Will their unfaithfulness nullify God’s faithfulness?
Romans	3	4	Not at all! Let God be true, and every human being a liar. As it is written: “So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.”
Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness brings out God’s righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)
Romans	3	6	Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
Romans	3	7	Someone might argue, “If my falsehood enhances God’s truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?”
Romans	3	8	Why not say—as some slanderously claim that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is just!
Romans	3	9	What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.
Romans	3	10	As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;
Romans	3	11	there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
Romans	3	12	All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”
Romans	3	13	“Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”
Romans	3	14	“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”
Romans	3	15	“Their feet are swift to shed blood;
Romans	3	16	ruin and misery mark their ways,
Romans	3	17	and the way of peace they do not know.”
Romans	3	18	“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”
Romans	3	19	Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
Romans	3	20	Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.
Romans	3	21	But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
Romans	3	22	This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,
Romans	3	23	for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
Romans	3	24	and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
Romans	3	25	God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—
Romans	3	26	he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
Romans	3	27	Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. Because of what law? The law that requires works? No, because of the law that requires faith.
Romans	3	28	For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Romans	3	29	Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
Romans	3	30	since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
Romans	3	31	Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
Romans	4	1	What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter?
Romans	4	2	If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God.
Romans	4	3	What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”
Romans	4	4	Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation.
Romans	4	5	However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.
Romans	4	6	David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
Romans	4	7	“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
Romans	4	8	Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”
Romans	4	9	Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness.
Romans	4	10	Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!
Romans	4	11	And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.
Romans	4	12	And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
Romans	4	13	It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
Romans	4	14	For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless,
Romans	4	15	because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
Romans	4	16	Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
Romans	4	17	As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not.
Romans	4	18	Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your offspring be.”
Romans	4	19	Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—and that Sarah’s womb was also dead.
Romans	4	20	Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
Romans	4	21	being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
Romans	4	22	This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”
Romans	4	23	The words “it was credited to him” were written not for him alone,
Romans	4	24	but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
Romans	4	25	He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
Romans	5	1	Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
Romans	5	2	through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we boast in the hope of the glory of God.
Romans	5	3	Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
Romans	5	4	perseverance, character; and character, hope.
Romans	5	5	And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.
Romans	5	6	You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
Romans	5	7	Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die.
Romans	5	8	But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
Romans	5	9	Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!
Romans	5	10	For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
Romans	5	11	Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
Romans	5	12	Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned—
Romans	5	13	To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone’s account where there is no law.
Romans	5	14	Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who is a pattern of the one to come.
Romans	5	15	But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
Romans	5	16	Nor can the gift of God be compared with the result of one man’s sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
Romans	5	17	For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God’s abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
Romans	5	18	Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.
Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
Romans	5	20	The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
Romans	5	21	so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Romans	6	1	What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
Romans	6	2	By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?
Romans	6	3	Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
Romans	6	4	We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
Romans	6	5	For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
Romans	6	6	For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—
Romans	6	7	because anyone who has died has been set free from sin.
Romans	6	8	Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
Romans	6	9	For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
Romans	6	10	The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
Romans	6	11	In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
Romans	6	12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.
Romans	6	13	Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.
Romans	6	14	For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.
Romans	6	15	What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means!
Romans	6	16	Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance.
Romans	6	18	You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
Romans	6	19	I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness.
Romans	6	20	When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
Romans	6	21	What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
Romans	6	22	But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans	7	1	Do you not know, brothers and sisters—for I am speaking to those who know the law—that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives?
Romans	7	2	For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.
Romans	7	3	So then, if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
Romans	7	4	So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.
Romans	7	5	For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.
Romans	7	6	But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
Romans	7	7	What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”
Romans	7	8	But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead.
Romans	7	9	Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
Romans	7	10	I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
Romans	7	11	For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.
Romans	7	12	So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
Romans	7	13	Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Nevertheless, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used what is good to bring about my death, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
Romans	7	14	We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
Romans	7	15	I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.
Romans	7	16	And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
Romans	7	17	As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
Romans	7	18	For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
Romans	7	19	For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.
Romans	7	20	Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
Romans	7	21	So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
Romans	7	22	For in my inner being I delight in God’s law;
Romans	7	23	but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me.
Romans	7	24	What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
Romans	8	1	Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
Romans	8	2	because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.
Romans	8	3	For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,
Romans	8	4	in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
Romans	8	5	Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
Romans	8	6	The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.
Romans	8	7	The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.
Romans	8	8	Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.
Romans	8	9	You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ.
Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
Romans	8	11	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you.
Romans	8	12	Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it.
Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live.
Romans	8	14	For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.
Romans	8	15	The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship. And by him we cry, “ Abba, Father.”
Romans	8	16	The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.
Romans	8	17	Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
Romans	8	18	I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
Romans	8	19	For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
Romans	8	20	For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
Romans	8	21	that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.
Romans	8	22	We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
Romans	8	23	Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies.
Romans	8	24	For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have?
Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
Romans	8	26	In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.
Romans	8	27	And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.
Romans	8	28	And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
Romans	8	29	For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
Romans	8	30	And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
Romans	8	31	What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
Romans	8	32	He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
Romans	8	33	Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
Romans	8	34	Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
Romans	8	36	As it is written: “For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”
Romans	8	37	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
Romans	8	39	neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Romans	9	1	I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit—
Romans	9	2	I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race,
Romans	9	4	the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.
Romans	9	5	Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
Romans	9	6	It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
Romans	9	7	Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”
Romans	9	8	In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring.
Romans	9	9	For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”
Romans	9	10	Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac.
Romans	9	11	Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:
Romans	9	12	not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”
Romans	9	13	Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”
Romans	9	14	What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”
Romans	9	16	It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.
Romans	9	17	For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”
Romans	9	18	Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
Romans	9	19	One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?”
Romans	9	20	But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”
Romans	9	21	Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?
Romans	9	22	What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?
Romans	9	23	What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—
Romans	9	24	even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
Romans	9	25	As he says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘my people’ who are not my people; and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who is not my loved one,”
Romans	9	26	and, “In the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’ ”
Romans	9	27	Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
Romans	9	28	For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.”
Romans	9	29	It is just as Isaiah said previously: “Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.”
Romans	9	30	What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
Romans	9	31	but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal.
Romans	9	32	Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.
Romans	9	33	As it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame.”
Revelation	1	1	The revelation from Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
Revelation	1	2	who testifies to everything he saw—that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
Revelation	1	3	Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
Revelation	1	4	John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,
Revelation	1	5	and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
Revelation	1	6	and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father—to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
Revelation	1	7	“Look, he is coming with the clouds,” and “every eye will see him, even those who pierced him”; and all peoples on earth “will mourn because of him.” So shall it be! Amen.
Revelation	1	8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”
Revelation	1	9	I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
Revelation	1	10	On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
Revelation	1	11	which said: “Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”
Revelation	1	12	I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
Revelation	1	13	and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
Revelation	1	14	The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
Revelation	1	15	His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
Revelation	1	16	In his right hand he held seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
Revelation	1	17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
Revelation	1	18	I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
Revelation	1	19	“Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.
Revelation	1	20	The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
Revelation	10	1	Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars.
Revelation	10	2	He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
Revelation	10	3	and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down.”
Revelation	10	5	Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
Revelation	10	6	And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, “There will be no more delay!
Revelation	10	7	But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”
Revelation	10	8	Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more: “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
Revelation	10	9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but ‘in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.’ ”
Revelation	10	10	I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
Revelation	10	11	Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings.”
Revelation	11	1	I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers.
Revelation	11	2	But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
Revelation	11	3	And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”
Revelation	11	4	They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”
Revelation	11	5	If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
Revelation	11	6	They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
Revelation	11	7	Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.
Revelation	11	8	Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified.
Revelation	11	9	For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
Revelation	11	10	The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
Revelation	11	11	But after the three and a half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them.
Revelation	11	12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.
Revelation	11	13	At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
Revelation	11	14	The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
Revelation	11	15	The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.”
Revelation	11	16	And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
Revelation	11	17	saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
Revelation	11	18	The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small— and for destroying those who destroy the earth.”
Revelation	11	19	Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm.
Revelation	12	1	A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
Revelation	12	2	She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads.
Revelation	12	4	Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born.
Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.” And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
Revelation	12	6	The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
Revelation	12	7	Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
Revelation	12	8	But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
Revelation	12	9	The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: “Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
Revelation	12	11	They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.”
Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
Revelation	12	14	The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach.
Revelation	12	15	Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
Revelation	13	1	The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.
Revelation	13	2	The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.
Revelation	13	3	One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast.
Revelation	13	4	People worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, “Who is like the beast? Who can wage war against it?”
Revelation	13	5	The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise its authority for forty-two months.
Revelation	13	6	It opened its mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.
Revelation	13	7	It was given power to wage war against God’s holy people and to conquer them. And it was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.
Revelation	13	8	All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast—all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.
Revelation	13	9	Whoever has ears, let them hear.
Revelation	13	10	“If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity they will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword they will be killed.” This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of God’s people.
Revelation	13	11	Then I saw a second beast, coming out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
Revelation	13	12	It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.
Revelation	13	13	And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people.
Revelation	13	14	Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth. It ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
Revelation	13	15	The second beast was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.
Revelation	13	16	It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,
Revelation	13	17	so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.
Revelation	13	18	This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
Revelation	14	1	Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.
Revelation	14	2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
Revelation	14	3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
Revelation	14	4	These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they remained virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among mankind and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
Revelation	14	5	No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people.
Revelation	14	7	He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.”
Revelation	14	8	A second angel followed and said, “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great,’ which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.”
Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives its mark on their forehead or on their hand,
Revelation	14	10	they, too, will drink the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. They will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment will rise for ever and ever. There will be no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”
Revelation	14	12	This calls for patient endurance on the part of the people of God who keep his commands and remain faithful to Jesus.
Revelation	14	13	Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.”
Revelation	14	14	I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
Revelation	14	15	Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.”
Revelation	14	16	So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
Revelation	14	17	Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
Revelation	14	18	Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.”
Revelation	14	19	The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.
Revelation	14	20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses’ bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
Revelation	15	1	I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign: seven angels with the seven last plagues—last, because with them God’s wrath is completed.
Revelation	15	2	And I saw what looked like a sea of glass glowing with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and its image and over the number of its name. They held harps given them by God
Revelation	15	3	and sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.
Revelation	15	4	Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”
Revelation	15	5	After this I looked, and I saw in heaven the temple—that is, the tabernacle of the covenant law—and it was opened.
Revelation	15	6	Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.
Revelation	15	7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.
Revelation	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
Revelation	16	1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath on the earth.”
Revelation	16	2	The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
Revelation	16	3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, and every living thing in the sea died.
Revelation	16	4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
Revelation	16	5	Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: “You are just in these judgments, O Holy One, you who are and who were;
Revelation	16	6	for they have shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
Revelation	16	7	And I heard the altar respond: “Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments.”
Revelation	16	8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was allowed to scorch people with fire.
Revelation	16	9	They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.
Revelation	16	10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony
Revelation	16	11	and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.
Revelation	16	12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.
Revelation	16	13	Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
Revelation	16	14	They are demonic spirits that perform signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
Revelation	16	15	“Look, I come like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake and remains clothed, so as not to go naked and be shamefully exposed.”
Revelation	16	16	Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
Revelation	16	17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!”
Revelation	16	18	Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake.
Revelation	16	19	The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.
Revelation	16	20	Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.
Revelation	16	21	From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.
Revelation	17	1	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits by many waters.
Revelation	17	2	With her the kings of the earth committed adultery, and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.”
Revelation	17	3	Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation	17	4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
Revelation	17	5	The name written on her forehead was a mystery: babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth.
Revelation	17	6	I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.
Revelation	17	7	Then the angel said to me: “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
Revelation	17	8	The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and yet will come up out of the Abyss and go to its destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because it once was, now is not, and yet will come.
Revelation	17	9	“This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.
Revelation	17	10	They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while.
Revelation	17	11	The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.
Revelation	17	12	“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.
Revelation	17	13	They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
Revelation	17	14	They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings—and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.”
Revelation	17	15	Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.
Revelation	17	16	The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
Revelation	17	17	For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to hand over to the beast their royal authority, until God’s words are fulfilled.
Revelation	17	18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
Revelation	18	1	After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
Revelation	18	2	With a mighty voice he shouted: “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal.
Revelation	18	3	For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.”
Revelation	18	4	Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “ ‘Come out of her, my people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;
Revelation	18	5	for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
Revelation	18	6	Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Pour her a double portion from her own cup.
Revelation	18	7	Give her as much torment and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, ‘I sit enthroned as queen. I am not a widow; I will never mourn.’
Revelation	18	8	Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
Revelation	18	9	“When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.
Revelation	18	10	Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, you mighty city of Babylon! In one hour your doom has come!’
Revelation	18	11	“The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes anymore—
Revelation	18	12	cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;
Revelation	18	13	cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and human beings sold as slaves.
Revelation	18	14	“They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your luxury and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.’
Revelation	18	15	The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn
Revelation	18	16	and cry out: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!
Revelation	18	17	In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!’ “Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.
Revelation	18	18	When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, ‘Was there ever a city like this great city?’
Revelation	18	19	They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: “ ‘Woe! Woe to you, great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!’
Revelation	18	20	“Rejoice over her, you heavens! Rejoice, you people of God! Rejoice, apostles and prophets! For God has judged her with the judgment she imposed on you.”
Revelation	18	21	Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: “With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.
Revelation	18	22	The music of harpists and musicians, pipers and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No worker of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.
Revelation	18	23	The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world’s important people. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
Revelation	18	24	In her was found the blood of prophets and of God’s holy people, of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
Revelation	19	1	After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
Revelation	19	2	for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.”
Revelation	19	3	And again they shouted: “Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.”
Revelation	19	4	The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: “Amen, Hallelujah!”
Revelation	19	5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying: “Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both great and small!”
Revelation	19	6	Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting: “Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns.
Revelation	19	7	Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
Revelation	19	8	Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear.” (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of God’s holy people.)
Revelation	19	9	Then the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!” And he added, “These are the true words of God.”
Revelation	19	10	At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For it is the Spirit of prophecy who bears testimony to Jesus.”
Revelation	19	11	I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war.
Revelation	19	12	His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
Revelation	19	13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
Revelation	19	14	The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
Revelation	19	15	Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
Revelation	19	16	On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: king of kings and lord of lords.
Revelation	19	17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
Revelation	19	18	so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.”
Revelation	19	19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
Revelation	19	20	But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
Revelation	19	21	The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
Revelation	2	1	“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.
Revelation	2	2	I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.
Revelation	2	3	You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.
Revelation	2	4	Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.
Revelation	2	5	Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
Revelation	2	6	But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Revelation	2	7	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
Revelation	2	8	“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
Revelation	2	9	I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
Revelation	2	10	Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.
Revelation	2	11	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.
Revelation	2	12	“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.
Revelation	2	13	I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.
Revelation	2	14	Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.
Revelation	2	15	Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
Revelation	2	16	Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
Revelation	2	17	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.
Revelation	2	18	“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
Revelation	2	19	I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.
Revelation	2	20	Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
Revelation	2	21	I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
Revelation	2	22	So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.
Revelation	2	23	I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
Revelation	2	24	Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you,
Revelation	2	25	except to hold on to what you have until I come.’
Revelation	2	26	To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—
Revelation	2	27	that one ‘will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery’ —just as I have received authority from my Father.
Revelation	2	28	I will also give that one the morning star.
Revelation	2	29	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation	20	1	And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.
Revelation	20	2	He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
Revelation	20	3	He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
Revelation	20	4	I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
Revelation	20	5	(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
Revelation	20	7	When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
Revelation	20	8	and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
Revelation	20	9	They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
Revelation	20	10	And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
Revelation	20	11	Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
Revelation	20	13	The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what they had done.
Revelation	20	14	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
Revelation	20	15	Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
Revelation	21	1	Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
Revelation	21	2	I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
Revelation	21	3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
Revelation	21	4	‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
Revelation	21	5	He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
Revelation	21	6	He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
Revelation	21	7	Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.
Revelation	21	8	But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
Revelation	21	9	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
Revelation	21	10	And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
Revelation	21	11	It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
Revelation	21	12	It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
Revelation	21	13	There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.
Revelation	21	14	The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
Revelation	21	15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.
Revelation	21	16	The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.
Revelation	21	17	The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick.
Revelation	21	18	The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
Revelation	21	19	The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
Revelation	21	20	the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
Revelation	21	21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.
Revelation	21	22	I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
Revelation	21	23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
Revelation	21	24	The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.
Revelation	21	25	On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
Revelation	21	26	The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
Revelation	21	27	Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
Revelation	22	1	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
Revelation	22	2	down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
Revelation	22	3	No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.
Revelation	22	4	They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
Revelation	22	5	There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
Revelation	22	6	The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God who inspires the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.”
Revelation	22	7	“Look, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy written in this scroll.”
Revelation	22	8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.
Revelation	22	9	But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your fellow prophets and with all who keep the words of this scroll. Worship God!”
Revelation	22	10	Then he told me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this scroll, because the time is near.
Revelation	22	11	Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who does right continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy.”
Revelation	22	12	“Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done.
Revelation	22	13	I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
Revelation	22	14	“Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
Revelation	22	15	Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
Revelation	22	16	“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.”
Revelation	22	17	The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let the one who hears say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come; and let the one who wishes take the free gift of the water of life.
Revelation	22	18	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this scroll: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this scroll.
Revelation	22	19	And if anyone takes words away from this scroll of prophecy, God will take away from that person any share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this scroll.
Revelation	22	20	He who testifies to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
Revelation	22	21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.
Revelation	3	1	“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
Revelation	3	2	Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have found your deeds unfinished in the sight of my God.
Revelation	3	3	Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
Revelation	3	4	Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
Revelation	3	5	The one who is victorious will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out the name of that person from the book of life, but will acknowledge that name before my Father and his angels.
Revelation	3	6	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation	3	7	“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
Revelation	3	8	I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
Revelation	3	9	I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars—I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
Revelation	3	10	Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.
Revelation	3	11	I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
Revelation	3	12	The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will they leave it. I will write on them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.
Revelation	3	13	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
Revelation	3	14	“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation.
Revelation	3	15	I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
Revelation	3	16	So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
Revelation	3	17	You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
Revelation	3	18	I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
Revelation	3	19	Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent.
Revelation	3	20	Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me.
Revelation	3	21	To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.
Revelation	3	22	Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
Revelation	4	1	After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”
Revelation	4	2	At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
Revelation	4	3	And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne.
Revelation	4	4	Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.
Revelation	4	5	From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.
Revelation	4	6	Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.
Revelation	4	7	The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
Revelation	4	8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: “ ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,’ who was, and is, and is to come.”
Revelation	4	9	Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,
Revelation	4	10	the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
Revelation	4	11	“You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being.”
Revelation	5	1	Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
Revelation	5	2	And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”
Revelation	5	3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
Revelation	5	4	I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
Revelation	5	5	Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
Revelation	5	6	Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
Revelation	5	7	He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
Revelation	5	8	And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people.
Revelation	5	9	And they sang a new song, saying: “You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation.
Revelation	5	10	You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”
Revelation	5	11	Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
Revelation	5	12	In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!”
Revelation	5	13	Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!”
Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
Revelation	6	1	I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!”
Revelation	6	2	I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
Revelation	6	3	When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”
Revelation	6	4	Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.
Revelation	6	5	When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
Revelation	6	6	Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds of wheat for a day’s wages, and six pounds of barley for a day’s wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!”
Revelation	6	7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
Revelation	6	8	I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
Revelation	6	9	When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.
Revelation	6	10	They called out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?”
Revelation	6	11	Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters, were killed just as they had been.
Revelation	6	12	I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
Revelation	6	13	and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.
Revelation	6	14	The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
Revelation	6	15	Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
Revelation	6	16	They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
Revelation	6	17	For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can withstand it?”
Revelation	7	1	After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
Revelation	7	2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:
Revelation	7	3	“Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”
Revelation	7	4	Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
Revelation	7	5	From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
Revelation	7	6	from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
Revelation	7	7	from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
Revelation	7	8	from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
Revelation	7	9	After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.
Revelation	7	10	And they cried out in a loud voice: “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.”
Revelation	7	11	All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
Revelation	7	12	saying: “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”
Revelation	7	13	Then one of the elders asked me, “These in white robes—who are they, and where did they come from?”
Revelation	7	14	I answered, “Sir, you know.” And he said, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
Revelation	7	15	Therefore, “they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
Revelation	7	16	‘Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat down on them,’ nor any scorching heat.
Revelation	7	17	For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; ‘he will lead them to springs of living water.’ ‘And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.’ ”
Revelation	8	1	When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
Revelation	8	3	Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all God’s people, on the golden altar in front of the throne.
Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God’s people, went up before God from the angel’s hand.
Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
Revelation	8	6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
Revelation	8	7	The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down on the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
Revelation	8	8	The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,
Revelation	8	9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
Revelation	8	10	The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—
Revelation	8	11	the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
Revelation	8	12	The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
Revelation	8	13	As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!”
Revelation	9	1	The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
Revelation	9	2	When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.
Revelation	9	3	And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.
Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
Revelation	9	5	They were not allowed to kill them but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.
Revelation	9	6	During those days people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.
Revelation	9	7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
Revelation	9	8	Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth.
Revelation	9	9	They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
Revelation	9	10	They had tails with stingers, like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.
Revelation	9	11	They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).
Revelation	9	12	The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
Revelation	9	13	The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God.
Revelation	9	14	It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”
Revelation	9	15	And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
Revelation	9	16	The number of the mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.
Revelation	9	17	The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.
Revelation	9	18	A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
Revelation	9	19	The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.
Revelation	9	20	The rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood—idols that cannot see or hear or walk.
Revelation	9	21	Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.
Psalms	1	1	Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers,
Psalms	1	2	but whose delight is in the law of the Lord , and who meditates on his law day and night.
Psalms	1	3	That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither— whatever they do prospers.
Psalms	1	4	Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.
Psalms	1	5	Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
Psalms	1	6	For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
Psalms	10	1	Why, Lord , do you stand far off? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?
Psalms	10	2	In his arrogance the wicked man hunts down the weak, who are caught in the schemes he devises.
Psalms	10	3	He boasts about the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the Lord .
Psalms	10	4	In his pride the wicked man does not seek him; in all his thoughts there is no room for God.
Psalms	10	5	His ways are always prosperous; your laws are rejected by him; he sneers at all his enemies.
Psalms	10	6	He says to himself, “Nothing will ever shake me.” He swears, “No one will ever do me harm.”
Psalms	10	7	His mouth is full of lies and threats; trouble and evil are under his tongue.
Psalms	10	8	He lies in wait near the villages; from ambush he murders the innocent. His eyes watch in secret for his victims;
Psalms	10	9	like a lion in cover he lies in wait. He lies in wait to catch the helpless; he catches the helpless and drags them off in his net.
Psalms	10	10	His victims are crushed, they collapse; they fall under his strength.
Psalms	10	11	He says to himself, “God will never notice; he covers his face and never sees.”
Psalms	10	12	Arise, Lord ! Lift up your hand, O God. Do not forget the helpless.
Psalms	10	13	Why does the wicked man revile God? Why does he say to himself, “He won’t call me to account”?
Psalms	10	14	But you, God, see the trouble of the afflicted; you consider their grief and take it in hand. The victims commit themselves to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.
Psalms	10	15	Break the arm of the wicked man; call the evildoer to account for his wickedness that would not otherwise be found out.
Psalms	10	16	The Lord is King for ever and ever; the nations will perish from his land.
Psalms	10	17	You, Lord , hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry,
Psalms	10	18	defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror.
Psalms	100	1	Shout for joy to the Lord , all the earth.
Psalms	100	2	Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs.
Psalms	100	3	Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his ; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
Psalms	100	4	Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.
Psalms	100	5	For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.
Psalms	101	1	I will sing of your love and justice; to you, Lord , I will sing praise.
Psalms	101	2	I will be careful to lead a blameless life— when will you come to me? I will conduct the affairs of my house with a blameless heart.
Psalms	101	3	I will not look with approval on anything that is vile. I hate what faithless people do; I will have no part in it.
Psalms	101	4	The perverse of heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with what is evil.
Psalms	101	5	Whoever slanders their neighbor in secret, I will put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, I will not tolerate.
Psalms	101	6	My eyes will be on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; the one whose walk is blameless will minister to me.
Psalms	101	7	No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.
Psalms	101	8	Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the Lord .
Psalms	102	1	Hear my prayer, Lord ; let my cry for help come to you.
Psalms	102	2	Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.
Psalms	102	3	For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.
Psalms	102	4	My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.
Psalms	102	5	In my distress I groan aloud and am reduced to skin and bones.
Psalms	102	6	I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.
Psalms	102	7	I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.
Psalms	102	8	All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
Psalms	102	9	For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears
Psalms	102	10	because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.
Psalms	102	11	My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
Psalms	102	12	But you, Lord , sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.
Psalms	102	13	You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.
Psalms	102	14	For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.
Psalms	102	15	The nations will fear the name of the Lord , all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
Psalms	102	16	For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.
Psalms	102	17	He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.
Psalms	102	18	Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord :
Psalms	102	19	“The Lord looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,
Psalms	102	20	to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death.”
Psalms	102	21	So the name of the Lord will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem
Psalms	102	22	when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the Lord .
Psalms	102	23	In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days.
Psalms	102	24	So I said: “Do not take me away, my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.
Psalms	102	25	In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
Psalms	102	26	They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.
Psalms	102	27	But you remain the same, and your years will never end.
Psalms	102	28	The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you.”
Psalms	103	1	Praise the Lord , my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
Psalms	103	2	Praise the Lord , my soul, and forget not all his benefits—
Psalms	103	3	who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,
Psalms	103	4	who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,
Psalms	103	5	who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
Psalms	103	6	The Lord works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
Psalms	103	7	He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel:
Psalms	103	8	The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
Psalms	103	9	He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;
Psalms	103	10	he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
Psalms	103	11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;
Psalms	103	12	as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
Psalms	103	13	As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him;
Psalms	103	14	for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.
Psalms	103	15	The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;
Psalms	103	16	the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.
Psalms	103	17	But from everlasting to everlasting the Lord ’s love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children’s children—
Psalms	103	18	with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
Psalms	103	19	The Lord has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
Psalms	103	20	Praise the Lord , you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.
Psalms	103	21	Praise the Lord , all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.
Psalms	103	22	Praise the Lord , all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the Lord , my soul.
Psalms	104	1	Praise the Lord , my soul. Lord my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
Psalms	104	2	The Lord wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent
Psalms	104	3	and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
Psalms	104	4	He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.
Psalms	104	5	He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.
Psalms	104	6	You covered it with the watery depths as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
Psalms	104	7	But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;
Psalms	104	8	they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.
Psalms	104	9	You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.
Psalms	104	10	He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.
Psalms	104	11	They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
Psalms	104	12	The birds of the sky nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.
Psalms	104	13	He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the land is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
Psalms	104	14	He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for people to cultivate— bringing forth food from the earth:
Psalms	104	15	wine that gladdens human hearts, oil to make their faces shine, and bread that sustains their hearts.
Psalms	104	16	The trees of the Lord are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
Psalms	104	17	There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the junipers.
Psalms	104	18	The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the hyrax.
Psalms	104	19	He made the moon to mark the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.
Psalms	104	20	You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
Psalms	104	21	The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
Psalms	104	22	The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.
Psalms	104	23	Then people go out to their work, to their labor until evening.
Psalms	104	24	How many are your works, Lord ! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
Psalms	104	25	There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number— living things both large and small.
Psalms	104	26	There the ships go to and fro, and Leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
Psalms	104	27	All creatures look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
Psalms	104	28	When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
Psalms	104	29	When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
Psalms	104	30	When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground.
Psalms	104	31	May the glory of the Lord endure forever; may the Lord rejoice in his works—
Psalms	104	32	he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
Psalms	104	33	I will sing to the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
Psalms	104	34	May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the Lord .
Psalms	104	35	But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the Lord , my soul. Praise the Lord .
Psalms	105	1	Give praise to the Lord , proclaim his name; make known among the nations what he has done.
Psalms	105	2	Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
Psalms	105	3	Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
Psalms	105	4	Look to the Lord and his strength; seek his face always.
Psalms	105	5	Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
Psalms	105	6	you his servants, the descendants of Abraham, his chosen ones, the children of Jacob.
Psalms	105	7	He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
Psalms	105	8	He remembers his covenant forever, the promise he made, for a thousand generations,
Psalms	105	9	the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
Psalms	105	10	He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
Psalms	105	11	“To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit.”
Psalms	105	12	When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
Psalms	105	13	they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
Psalms	105	14	He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings:
Psalms	105	15	“Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm.”
Psalms	105	16	He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;
Psalms	105	17	and he sent a man before them— Joseph, sold as a slave.
Psalms	105	18	They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,
Psalms	105	19	till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the Lord proved him true.
Psalms	105	20	The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.
Psalms	105	21	He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,
Psalms	105	22	to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
Psalms	105	23	Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob resided as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	24	The Lord made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,
Psalms	105	25	whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.
Psalms	105	26	He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
Psalms	105	27	They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.
Psalms	105	28	He sent darkness and made the land dark— for had they not rebelled against his words?
Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.
Psalms	105	30	Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
Psalms	105	31	He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
Psalms	105	32	He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;
Psalms	105	33	he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
Psalms	105	34	He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;
Psalms	105	35	they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.
Psalms	105	36	Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.
Psalms	105	37	He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.
Psalms	105	38	Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
Psalms	105	39	He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.
Psalms	105	40	They asked, and he brought them quail; he fed them well with the bread of heaven.
Psalms	105	41	He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed like a river in the desert.
Psalms	105	42	For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.
Psalms	105	43	He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;
Psalms	105	44	he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for—

Psalms	106	1	Praise the Lord . Give thanks to the Lord , for he is good; his love endures forever.

Psalms	106	4	Remember me, Lord , when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,
Psalms	106	5	that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.
Psalms	106	6	We have sinned, even as our ancestors did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
Psalms	106	7	When our ancestors were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
Psalms	106	8	Yet he saved them for his name’s sake, to make his mighty power known.
Psalms	106	9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.
Psalms	106	10	He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.
Psalms	106	11	The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
Psalms	106	12	Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.
Psalms	106	13	But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his plan to unfold.
Psalms	106	14	In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wilderness they put God to the test.
Psalms	106	15	So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease among them.
Psalms	106	16	In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the Lord .
Psalms	106	17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.

Psalms	106	19	At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
Psalms	106	20	They exchanged their glorious God for an image of a bull, which eats grass.
Psalms	106	21	They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
Psalms	106	22	miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
Psalms	106	23	So he said he would destroy them— had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.
Psalms	106	24	Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.
Psalms	106	25	They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the Lord .
Psalms	106	26	So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the wilderness,
Psalms	106	27	make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
Psalms	106	28	They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
Psalms	106	29	they aroused the Lord ’s anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
Psalms	106	30	But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.
Psalms	106	31	This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
Psalms	106	32	By the waters of Meribah they angered the Lord , and trouble came to Moses because of them;
Psalms	106	33	for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses’ lips.
Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the peoples as the Lord had commanded them,
Psalms	106	35	but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
Psalms	106	36	They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
Psalms	106	37	They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to false gods.
Psalms	106	38	They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.
Psalms	106	39	They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
Psalms	106	40	Therefore the Lord was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.
Psalms	106	41	He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
Psalms	106	42	Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
Psalms	106	43	Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.
Psalms	106	44	Yet he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;
Psalms	106	45	for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented.
Psalms	106	46	He caused all who held them captive to show them mercy.
Psalms	106	47	Save us, Lord our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise.

Psalms	107	4	Some wandered in desert wastelands, finding no way to a city where they could settle.

Psalms	107	8	Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
Psalms	107	9	for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
Psalms	107	10	Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains,
Psalms	107	11	because they rebelled against God’s commands and despised the plans of the Most High.
Psalms	107	12	So he subjected them to bitter labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
Psalms	107	13	Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness, and broke away their chains.

Psalms	107	24	They saw the works of the Lord , his wonderful deeds in the deep.
Psalms	107	25	For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves.
Psalms	107	26	They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away.
Psalms	107	27	They reeled and staggered like drunkards; they were at their wits’ end.
Psalms	107	28	Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress.
Psalms	107	29	He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.
Psalms	107	30	They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven.
Psalms	107	31	Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
Psalms	107	32	Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders.
Psalms	107	33	He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground,
Psalms	107	34	and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there.
Psalms	107	35	He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;
Psalms	107	36	there he brought the hungry to live, and they founded a city where they could settle.
Psalms	107	37	They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest;
Psalms	107	38	he blessed them, and their numbers greatly increased, and he did not let their herds diminish.
Psalms	107	39	Then their numbers decreased, and they were humbled by oppression, calamity and sorrow;

Psalms	33	16	No king is saved by the size of his army; no warrior escapes by his great strength.
Psalms	33	17	A horse is a vain hope for deliverance; despite all its great strength it cannot save.

Psalms	34	13	keep your tongue from evil and your lips from telling lies.
Psalms	34	14	Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
Psalms	34	15	The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry;

Psalms	35	2	Take up shield and armor; arise and come to my aid.
Psalms	35	3	Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to me, “I am your salvation.”
Psalms	35	4	May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.
Psalms	35	5	May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away;
Psalms	35	6	may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.
Psalms	35	7	Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,
Psalms	35	8	may ruin overtake them by surprise— may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
Psalms	35	9	Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord and delight in his salvation.
Psalms	35	10	My whole being will exclaim, “Who is like you, Lord ? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them.”
Psalms	35	11	Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.
Psalms	35	12	They repay me evil for good and leave me like one bereaved.
Psalms	35	13	Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
Psalms	35	14	I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.
Psalms	35	15	But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; assailants gathered against me without my knowledge. They slandered me without ceasing.
Psalms	35	16	Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.
Psalms	35	17	How long, Lord, will you look on? Rescue me from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.
Psalms	35	18	I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among the throngs I will praise you.
Psalms	35	19	Do not let those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; do not let those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.
Psalms	35	20	They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.
Psalms	35	21	They sneer at me and say, “Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it.”
Psalms	35	22	Lord , you have seen this; do not be silent. Do not be far from me, Lord.
Psalms	35	23	Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.
Psalms	35	24	Vindicate me in your righteousness, Lord my God; do not let them gloat over me.
Psalms	35	25	Do not let them think, “Aha, just what we wanted!” or say, “We have swallowed him up.”
Psalms	35	26	May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.
Psalms	35	27	May those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and gladness; may they always say, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the well-being of his servant.”
Psalms	35	28	My tongue will proclaim your righteousness, your praises all day long.
Psalms	36	1	I have a message from God in my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked: There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Psalms	36	2	In their own eyes they flatter themselves too much to detect or hate their sin.
Psalms	36	3	The words of their mouths are wicked and deceitful; they fail to act wisely or do good.
Psalms	36	4	Even on their beds they plot evil; they commit themselves to a sinful course and do not reject what is wrong.
Psalms	36	5	Your love, Lord , reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.
Psalms	36	6	Your righteousness is like the highest mountains, your justice like the great deep. You, Lord , preserve both people and animals.
Psalms	36	7	How priceless is your unfailing love, O God! People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
Psalms	36	8	They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.
Psalms	36	9	For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.
Psalms	36	10	Continue your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Psalms	36	11	May the foot of the proud not come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
Psalms	36	12	See how the evildoers lie fallen— thrown down, not able to rise!

Psalms	37	15	But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.

Psalms	37	19	In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.

Psalms	37	24	though he may stumble, he will not fall, for the Lord upholds him with his hand.

Psalms	37	29	The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
Psalms	37	30	The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom, and their tongues speak what is just.
Psalms	37	31	The law of their God is in their hearts; their feet do not slip.
Psalms	37	32	The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, intent on putting them to death;
Psalms	37	33	but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked or let them be condemned when brought to trial.
Psalms	37	34	Hope in the Lord and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.
Psalms	37	35	I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,
Psalms	37	36	but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.
Psalms	37	37	Consider the blameless, observe the upright; a future awaits those who seek peace.
Psalms	37	38	But all sinners will be destroyed; there will be no future for the wicked.
Psalms	37	39	The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord ; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
Psalms	37	40	The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
Psalms	38	1	Lord , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
Psalms	38	2	Your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down on me.
Psalms	38	3	Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; there is no soundness in my bones because of my sin.
Psalms	38	4	My guilt has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear.
Psalms	38	5	My wounds fester and are loathsome because of my sinful folly.
Psalms	38	6	I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning.

Psalms	38	8	I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.
Psalms	38	9	All my longings lie open before you, Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.
Psalms	38	10	My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.
Psalms	38	11	My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.
Psalms	38	12	Those who want to kill me set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they scheme and lie.
Psalms	38	13	I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, like the mute, who cannot speak;
Psalms	38	14	I have become like one who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.
Psalms	38	15	Lord , I wait for you; you will answer, Lord my God.
Psalms	38	16	For I said, “Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my feet slip.”
Psalms	38	17	For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
Psalms	38	18	I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
Psalms	38	19	Many have become my enemies without cause ; those who hate me without reason are numerous.
Psalms	38	20	Those who repay my good with evil lodge accusations against me, though I seek only to do what is good.
Psalms	38	21	Lord , do not forsake me; do not be far from me, my God.

Psalms	39	1	I said, “I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth while in the presence of the wicked.”
Psalms	39	2	So I remained utterly silent, not even saying anything good. But my anguish increased;
Psalms	39	3	my heart grew hot within me. While I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue:
Psalms	39	4	“Show me, Lord , my life’s end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.
Psalms	39	5	You have made my days a mere handbreadth; the span of my years is as nothing before you. Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.
Psalms	39	6	“Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom; in vain they rush about, heaping up wealth without knowing whose it will finally be.
Psalms	39	7	“But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.
Psalms	39	8	Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.
Psalms	39	9	I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.
Psalms	39	10	Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
Psalms	39	11	When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin, you consume their wealth like a moth— surely everyone is but a breath.
Psalms	39	12	“Hear my prayer, Lord , listen to my cry for help; do not be deaf to my weeping. I dwell with you as a foreigner, a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
Psalms	39	13	Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again before I depart and am no more.”
Psalms	4	1	Answer me when I call to you, my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
Psalms	4	2	How long will you people turn my glory into shame? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods ?
Psalms	4	3	Know that the Lord has set apart his faithful servant for himself; the Lord hears when I call to him.
Psalms	4	4	Tremble and do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent.
Psalms	4	5	Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the Lord .
Psalms	4	6	Many, Lord , are asking, “Who will bring us prosperity?” Let the light of your face shine on us.
Psalms	4	7	Fill my heart with joy when their grain and new wine abound.
Psalms	4	8	In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, Lord , make me dwell in safety.
Psalms	40	1	I waited patiently for the Lord ; he turned to me and heard my cry.
Psalms	40	2	He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
Psalms	40	3	He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.
Psalms	40	4	Blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord , who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.
Psalms	40	5	Many, Lord my God, are the wonders you have done, the things you planned for us. None can compare with you; were I to speak and tell of your deeds, they would be too many to declare.
Psalms	40	6	Sacrifice and offering you did not desire— but my ears you have opened — burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
Psalms	40	7	Then I said, “Here I am, I have come— it is written about me in the scroll.
Psalms	40	8	I desire to do your will, my God; your law is within my heart.”
Psalms	40	9	I proclaim your saving acts in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, Lord , as you know.
Psalms	40	10	I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and your saving help. I do not conceal your love and your faithfulness from the great assembly.
Psalms	40	11	Do not withhold your mercy from me, Lord ; may your love and faithfulness always protect me.
Psalms	40	12	For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.
Psalms	40	13	Be pleased to save me, Lord ; come quickly, Lord , to help me.
Psalms	40	14	May all who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
Psalms	40	15	May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled at their own shame.
Psalms	40	16	But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”
Psalms	40	17	But as for me, I am poor and needy; may the Lord think of me. You are my help and my deliverer; you are my God, do not delay.
Psalms	41	1	Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble.

Psalms	41	3	The Lord sustains them on their sickbed and restores them from their bed of illness.
Psalms	41	4	I said, “Have mercy on me, Lord ; heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
Psalms	41	5	My enemies say of me in malice, “When will he die and his name perish?”
Psalms	41	6	When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it around.
Psalms	41	7	All my enemies whisper together against me; they imagine the worst for me, saying,
Psalms	41	8	“A vile disease has afflicted him; he will never get up from the place where he lies.”
Psalms	41	9	Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread, has turned against me.
Psalms	41	10	But may you have mercy on me, Lord ; raise me up, that I may repay them.
Psalms	41	11	I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
Psalms	41	12	Because of my integrity you uphold me and set me in your presence forever.
Psalms	41	13	Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.
Psalms	42	1	As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.
Psalms	42	2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?
Psalms	42	3	My tears have been my food day and night, while people say to me all day long, “Where is your God?”
Psalms	42	4	These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng.
Psalms	42	5	Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
Psalms	42	6	My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon—from Mount Mizar.

Psalms	42	11	Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
Psalms	43	1	Vindicate me, my God, and plead my cause against an unfaithful nation. Rescue me from those who are deceitful and wicked.
Psalms	43	2	You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?
Psalms	43	3	Send me your light and your faithful care, let them lead me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.
Psalms	43	4	Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the lyre, O God, my God.
Psalms	43	5	Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
Psalms	44	1	We have heard it with our ears, O God; our ancestors have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.
Psalms	44	2	With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our ancestors; you crushed the peoples and made our ancestors flourish.
Psalms	44	3	It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.
Psalms	44	4	You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.
Psalms	44	5	Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.

Psalms	44	15	I live in disgrace all day long, and my face is covered with shame
Psalms	44	16	at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.
Psalms	44	17	All this came upon us, though we had not forgotten you; we had not been false to your covenant.
Psalms	44	18	Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.
Psalms	44	19	But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals; you covered us over with deep darkness.
Psalms	44	20	If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
Psalms	44	21	would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?
Psalms	44	22	Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
Psalms	44	23	Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
Psalms	44	24	Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?

Psalms	48	2	Beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth, like the heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.
Psalms	48	3	God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.
Psalms	48	4	When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,
Psalms	48	5	they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror.
Psalms	48	6	Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.
Psalms	48	7	You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.
Psalms	48	8	As we have heard, so we have seen in the city of the Lord Almighty, in the city of our God: God makes her secure forever.
Psalms	48	9	Within your temple, O God, we meditate on your unfailing love.
Psalms	48	10	Like your name, O God, your praise reaches to the ends of the earth; your right hand is filled with righteousness.
Psalms	48	11	Mount Zion rejoices, the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments.
Psalms	48	12	Walk about Zion, go around her, count her towers,
Psalms	48	13	consider well her ramparts, view her citadels, that you may tell of them to the next generation.
Psalms	48	14	For this God is our God for ever and ever; he will be our guide even to the end.
Psalms	49	1	Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,
Psalms	49	2	both low and high, rich and poor alike:
Psalms	49	3	My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the meditation of my heart will give you understanding.
Psalms	49	4	I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle:
Psalms	49	5	Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me—
Psalms	49	6	those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?
Psalms	49	7	No one can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for them—
Psalms	49	8	the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough—
Psalms	49	9	so that they should live on forever and not see decay.
Psalms	49	10	For all can see that the wise die, that the foolish and the senseless also perish, leaving their wealth to others.
Psalms	49	11	Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves.
Psalms	49	12	People, despite their wealth, do not endure; they are like the beasts that perish.
Psalms	49	13	This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings.
Psalms	49	14	They are like sheep and are destined to die; death will be their shepherd (but the upright will prevail over them in the morning). Their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.
Psalms	49	15	But God will redeem me from the realm of the dead; he will surely take me to himself.
Psalms	49	16	Do not be overawed when others grow rich, when the splendor of their houses increases;
Psalms	49	17	for they will take nothing with them when they die, their splendor will not descend with them.
Psalms	49	18	Though while they live they count themselves blessed— and people praise you when you prosper—
Psalms	49	19	they will join those who have gone before them, who will never again see the light of life.
Psalms	49	20	People who have wealth but lack understanding are like the beasts that perish.
Psalms	5	1	Listen to my words, Lord , consider my lament.
Psalms	5	2	Hear my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray.
Psalms	5	3	In the morning, Lord , you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.
Psalms	5	4	For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness; with you, evil people are not welcome.
Psalms	5	5	The arrogant cannot stand in your presence. You hate all who do wrong;
Psalms	5	6	you destroy those who tell lies. The bloodthirsty and deceitful you, Lord , detest.
Psalms	5	7	But I, by your great love, can come into your house; in reverence I bow down toward your holy temple.
Psalms	5	8	Lead me, Lord , in your righteousness because of my enemies— make your way straight before me.
Psalms	5	9	Not a word from their mouth can be trusted; their heart is filled with malice. Their throat is an open grave; with their tongues they tell lies.
Psalms	5	10	Declare them guilty, O God! Let their intrigues be their downfall. Banish them for their many sins, for they have rebelled against you.
Psalms	5	11	But let all who take refuge in you be glad; let them ever sing for joy. Spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.
Psalms	5	12	Surely, Lord , you bless the righteous; you surround them with your favor as with a shield.
Psalms	50	1	The Mighty One, God, the Lord , speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to where it sets.
Psalms	50	2	From Zion, perfect in beauty, God shines forth.
Psalms	50	3	Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.
Psalms	50	4	He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people:
Psalms	50	5	“Gather to me this consecrated people, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
Psalms	50	6	And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for he is a God of justice.
Psalms	50	7	“Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel: I am God, your God.
Psalms	50	8	I bring no charges against you concerning your sacrifices or concerning your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
Psalms	50	9	I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,
Psalms	50	10	for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.
Psalms	50	11	I know every bird in the mountains, and the insects in the fields are mine.
Psalms	50	12	If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
Psalms	50	13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
Psalms	50	14	“Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,
Psalms	50	15	and call on me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.”
Psalms	50	16	But to the wicked person, God says: “What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
Psalms	50	17	You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.
Psalms	50	18	When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.
Psalms	50	19	You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.
Psalms	50	20	You sit and testify against your brother and slander your own mother’s son.
Psalms	50	21	When you did these things and I kept silent, you thought I was exactly like you. But I now arraign you and set my accusations before you.
Psalms	50	22	“Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with no one to rescue you:
Psalms	50	23	Those who sacrifice thank offerings honor me, and to the blameless I will show my salvation.”
Psalms	51	1	Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.
Psalms	51	2	Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
Psalms	51	3	For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
Psalms	51	4	Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight; so you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge.
Psalms	51	5	Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
Psalms	51	6	Yet you desired faithfulness even in the womb; you taught me wisdom in that secret place.
Psalms	51	7	Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
Psalms	51	8	Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
Psalms	51	9	Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.
Psalms	51	10	Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
Psalms	51	11	Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
Psalms	51	12	Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
Psalms	51	13	Then I will teach transgressors your ways, so that sinners will turn back to you.
Psalms	51	14	Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, you who are God my Savior, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
Psalms	51	15	Open my lips, Lord, and my mouth will declare your praise.
Psalms	51	16	You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
Psalms	51	17	My sacrifice, O God, is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart you, God, will not despise.
Psalms	51	18	May it please you to prosper Zion, to build up the walls of Jerusalem.
Psalms	51	19	Then you will delight in the sacrifices of the righteous, in burnt offerings offered whole; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
Psalms	52	1	Why do you boast of evil, you mighty hero? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
Psalms	52	2	You who practice deceit, your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor.
Psalms	52	3	You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth.
Psalms	52	4	You love every harmful word, you deceitful tongue!
Psalms	52	5	Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin: He will snatch you up and pluck you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living.
Psalms	52	6	The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at you, saying,
Psalms	52	7	“Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!”
Psalms	52	8	But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God’s unfailing love for ever and ever.
Psalms	52	9	For what you have done I will always praise you in the presence of your faithful people. And I will hope in your name, for your name is good.
Psalms	53	1	The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.
Psalms	53	2	God looks down from heaven on all mankind to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
Psalms	53	3	Everyone has turned away, all have become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
Psalms	53	4	Do all these evildoers know nothing? They devour my people as though eating bread; they never call on God.
Psalms	53	5	But there they are, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.
Psalms	53	6	Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
Psalms	54	1	Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.
Psalms	54	2	Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.
Psalms	54	3	Arrogant foes are attacking me; ruthless people are trying to kill me— people without regard for God.
Psalms	54	4	Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.
Psalms	54	5	Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.
Psalms	54	6	I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, Lord , for it is good.
Psalms	54	7	You have delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
Psalms	55	1	Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;
Psalms	55	2	hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
Psalms	55	3	because of what my enemy is saying, because of the threats of the wicked; for they bring down suffering on me and assail me in their anger.
Psalms	55	4	My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen on me.
Psalms	55	5	Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.
Psalms	55	6	I said, “Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest.
Psalms	55	7	I would flee far away and stay in the desert;
Psalms	55	8	I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm.”
Psalms	55	9	Lord, confuse the wicked, confound their words, for I see violence and strife in the city.
Psalms	55	10	Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.
Psalms	55	11	Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.
Psalms	55	12	If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.
Psalms	55	13	But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,
Psalms	55	14	with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.
Psalms	55	15	Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the realm of the dead, for evil finds lodging among them.
Psalms	55	16	As for me, I call to God, and the Lord saves me.
Psalms	55	17	Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.
Psalms	55	18	He rescues me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
Psalms	55	19	God, who is enthroned from of old, who does not change— he will hear them and humble them, because they have no fear of God.
Psalms	55	20	My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.
Psalms	55	21	His talk is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.
Psalms	55	22	Cast your cares on the Lord and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous be shaken.
Psalms	55	23	But you, God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of decay; the bloodthirsty and deceitful will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.
Psalms	56	1	Be merciful to me, my God, for my enemies are in hot pursuit; all day long they press their attack.
Psalms	56	2	My adversaries pursue me all day long; in their pride many are attacking me.
Psalms	56	3	When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.
Psalms	56	4	In God, whose word I praise— in God I trust and am not afraid. What can mere mortals do to me?
Psalms	56	5	All day long they twist my words; all their schemes are for my ruin.
Psalms	56	6	They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, hoping to take my life.
Psalms	56	7	Because of their wickedness do not let them escape; in your anger, God, bring the nations down.
Psalms	56	8	Record my misery; list my tears on your scroll — are they not in your record?
Psalms	56	9	Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.
Psalms	56	10	In God, whose word I praise, in the Lord , whose word I praise—
Psalms	56	11	in God I trust and am not afraid. What can man do to me?
Psalms	56	12	I am under vows to you, my God; I will present my thank offerings to you.
Psalms	56	13	For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
Psalms	57	1	Have mercy on me, my God, have mercy on me, for in you I take refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.
Psalms	57	2	I cry out to God Most High, to God, who vindicates me.
Psalms	57	3	He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me— God sends forth his love and his faithfulness.
Psalms	57	4	I am in the midst of lions; I am forced to dwell among ravenous beasts— men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
Psalms	57	5	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
Psalms	57	6	They spread a net for my feet— I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path— but they have fallen into it themselves.
Psalms	57	7	My heart, O God, is steadfast, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
Psalms	57	8	Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
Psalms	57	9	I will praise you, Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
Psalms	57	10	For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
Psalms	57	11	Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
Psalms	58	1	Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge people with equity?
Psalms	58	2	No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.
Psalms	58	3	Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward, spreading lies.
Psalms	58	4	Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,
Psalms	58	5	that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.
Psalms	58	6	Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; Lord , tear out the fangs of those lions!
Psalms	58	7	Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows fall short.
Psalms	58	8	May they be like a slug that melts away as it moves along, like a stillborn child that never sees the sun.
Psalms	58	9	Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns— whether they be green or dry—the wicked will be swept away.
Psalms	58	10	The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they dip their feet in the blood of the wicked.
Psalms	58	11	Then people will say, “Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth.”
Psalms	59	1	Deliver me from my enemies, O God; be my fortress against those who are attacking me.
Psalms	59	2	Deliver me from evildoers and save me from those who are after my blood.
Psalms	59	3	See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, Lord .
Psalms	59	4	I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!
Psalms	59	5	You, Lord God Almighty, you who are the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors.
Psalms	59	6	They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
Psalms	59	7	See what they spew from their mouths— the words from their lips are sharp as swords, and they think, “Who can hear us?”
Psalms	59	8	But you laugh at them, Lord ; you scoff at all those nations.
Psalms	59	9	You are my strength, I watch for you; you, God, are my fortress,
Psalms	59	10	my God on whom I can rely. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
Psalms	59	11	But do not kill them, Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might uproot them and bring them down.
Psalms	59	12	For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,
Psalms	59	13	consume them in your wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob.
Psalms	59	14	They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
Psalms	59	15	They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.
Psalms	59	16	But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
Psalms	59	17	You are my strength, I sing praise to you; you, God, are my fortress, my God on whom I can rely.
Psalms	6	1	Lord , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
Psalms	6	2	Have mercy on me, Lord , for I am faint; heal me, Lord , for my bones are in agony.
Psalms	6	3	My soul is in deep anguish. How long, Lord , how long?
Psalms	6	4	Turn, Lord , and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.
Psalms	6	5	Among the dead no one proclaims your name. Who praises you from the grave?
Psalms	6	6	I am worn out from my groaning. All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
Psalms	6	7	My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.
Psalms	6	8	Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.
Psalms	6	9	The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.
Psalms	6	10	All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish; they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
Psalms	60	1	You have rejected us, God, and burst upon us; you have been angry—now restore us!
Psalms	60	2	You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.
Psalms	60	3	You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
Psalms	60	4	But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow.
Psalms	60	5	Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.
Psalms	60	6	God has spoken from his sanctuary: “In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Sukkoth.
Psalms	60	7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah is my scepter.
Psalms	60	8	Moab is my washbasin, on Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
Psalms	60	9	Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Psalms	60	10	Is it not you, God, you who have now rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
Psalms	60	11	Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.
Psalms	60	12	With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
Psalms	61	1	Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.
Psalms	61	2	From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
Psalms	61	3	For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.
Psalms	61	4	I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
Psalms	61	5	For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
Psalms	61	6	Increase the days of the king’s life, his years for many generations.
Psalms	61	7	May he be enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him.
Psalms	61	8	Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day.
Psalms	62	1	Truly my soul finds rest in God; my salvation comes from him.
Psalms	62	2	Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
Psalms	62	3	How long will you assault me? Would all of you throw me down— this leaning wall, this tottering fence?
Psalms	62	4	Surely they intend to topple me from my lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse.
Psalms	62	5	Yes, my soul, find rest in God; my hope comes from him.
Psalms	62	6	Truly he is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
Psalms	62	7	My salvation and my honor depend on God ; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.
Psalms	62	8	Trust in him at all times, you people; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge.
Psalms	62	9	Surely the lowborn are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie. If weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.
Psalms	62	10	Do not trust in extortion or put vain hope in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
Psalms	62	11	One thing God has spoken, two things I have heard: “Power belongs to you, God,
Psalms	62	12	and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”; and, “You reward everyone according to what they have done.”
Psalms	63	1	You, God, are my God, earnestly I seek you; I thirst for you, my whole being longs for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water.
Psalms	63	2	I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
Psalms	63	3	Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.
Psalms	63	4	I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.
Psalms	63	5	I will be fully satisfied as with the richest of foods; with singing lips my mouth will praise you.
Psalms	63	6	On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night.
Psalms	63	7	Because you are my help, I sing in the shadow of your wings.
Psalms	63	8	I cling to you; your right hand upholds me.
Psalms	63	9	Those who want to kill me will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.
Psalms	63	10	They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.
Psalms	63	11	But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by God will glory in him, while the mouths of liars will be silenced.
Psalms	64	1	Hear me, my God, as I voice my complaint; protect my life from the threat of the enemy.
Psalms	64	2	Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the plots of evildoers.
Psalms	64	3	They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like deadly arrows.
Psalms	64	4	They shoot from ambush at the innocent; they shoot suddenly, without fear.
Psalms	64	5	They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, “Who will see it ?”
Psalms	64	6	They plot injustice and say, “We have devised a perfect plan!” Surely the human mind and heart are cunning.
Psalms	64	7	But God will shoot them with his arrows; they will suddenly be struck down.
Psalms	64	8	He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.
Psalms	64	9	All people will fear; they will proclaim the works of God and ponder what he has done.
Psalms	64	10	The righteous will rejoice in the Lord and take refuge in him; all the upright in heart will glory in him!
Psalms	65	1	Praise awaits you, our God, in Zion; to you our vows will be fulfilled.
Psalms	65	2	You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.
Psalms	65	3	When we were overwhelmed by sins, you forgave our transgressions.
Psalms	65	4	Blessed are those you choose and bring near to live in your courts! We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple.
Psalms	65	5	You answer us with awesome and righteous deeds, God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,
Psalms	65	6	who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,
Psalms	65	7	who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
Psalms	65	8	The whole earth is filled with awe at your wonders; where morning dawns, where evening fades, you call forth songs of joy.
Psalms	65	9	You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
Psalms	65	10	You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
Psalms	65	11	You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.
Psalms	65	12	The grasslands of the wilderness overflow; the hills are clothed with gladness.
Psalms	65	13	The meadows are covered with flocks and the valleys are mantled with grain; they shout for joy and sing.
Psalms	66	1	Shout for joy to God, all the earth!
Psalms	66	2	Sing the glory of his name; make his praise glorious.
Psalms	66	3	Say to God, “How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies cringe before you.
Psalms	66	4	All the earth bows down to you; they sing praise to you, they sing the praises of your name.”

Psalms	66	9	he has preserved our lives and kept our feet from slipping.
Psalms	66	10	For you, God, tested us; you refined us like silver.
Psalms	66	11	You brought us into prison and laid burdens on our backs.
Psalms	66	12	You let people ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.
Psalms	66	13	I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you—
Psalms	66	14	vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.
Psalms	66	15	I will sacrifice fat animals to you and an offering of rams; I will offer bulls and goats.
Psalms	66	16	Come and hear, all you who fear God; let me tell you what he has done for me.
Psalms	66	17	I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.
Psalms	66	18	If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened;
Psalms	66	19	but God has surely listened and has heard my prayer.
Psalms	66	20	Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld his love from me!
Psalms	67	1	May God be gracious to us and bless us and make his face shine on us—
Psalms	67	2	so that your ways may be known on earth, your salvation among all nations.
Psalms	67	3	May the peoples praise you, God; may all the peoples praise you.

Psalms	68	4	Sing to God, sing in praise of his name, extol him who rides on the clouds ; rejoice before him—his name is the Lord .
Psalms	68	5	A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling.
Psalms	68	6	God sets the lonely in families, he leads out the prisoners with singing; but the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
Psalms	68	7	When you, God, went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness,
Psalms	68	8	the earth shook, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel.
Psalms	68	9	You gave abundant showers, O God; you refreshed your weary inheritance.
Psalms	68	10	Your people settled in it, and from your bounty, God, you provided for the poor.
Psalms	68	11	The Lord announces the word, and the women who proclaim it are a mighty throng:
Psalms	68	12	“Kings and armies flee in haste; the women at home divide the plunder.
Psalms	68	13	Even while you sleep among the sheep pens, the wings of my dove are sheathed with silver, its feathers with shining gold.”
Psalms	68	14	When the Almighty scattered the kings in the land, it was like snow fallen on Mount Zalmon.
Psalms	68	15	Mount Bashan, majestic mountain, Mount Bashan, rugged mountain,
Psalms	68	16	why gaze in envy, you rugged mountain, at the mountain where God chooses to reign, where the Lord himself will dwell forever?
Psalms	68	17	The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands; the Lord has come from Sinai into his sanctuary.
Psalms	68	18	When you ascended on high, you took many captives; you received gifts from people, even from the rebellious— that you, Lord God, might dwell there.
Psalms	68	19	Praise be to the Lord, to God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens.
Psalms	68	20	Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign Lord comes escape from death.
Psalms	68	21	Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.
Psalms	68	22	The Lord says, “I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea,
Psalms	68	23	that your feet may wade in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share.”
Psalms	68	24	Your procession, God, has come into view, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
Psalms	68	25	In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the young women playing the timbrels.
Psalms	68	26	Praise God in the great congregation; praise the Lord in the assembly of Israel.
Psalms	68	27	There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah’s princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali.

Psalms	68	29	Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.

Psalms	68	31	Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush will submit herself to God.
Psalms	68	32	Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord,
Psalms	68	33	to him who rides across the highest heavens, the ancient heavens, who thunders with mighty voice.

Psalms	68	35	You, God, are awesome in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!
Psalms	69	1	Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
Psalms	69	2	I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.
Psalms	69	3	I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
Psalms	69	4	Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
Psalms	69	5	You, God, know my folly; my guilt is not hidden from you.
Psalms	69	6	Lord, the Lord Almighty, may those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me; God of Israel, may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me.
Psalms	69	7	For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.
Psalms	69	8	I am a foreigner to my own family, a stranger to my own mother’s children;
Psalms	69	9	for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
Psalms	69	10	When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;
Psalms	69	11	when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.
Psalms	69	12	Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.
Psalms	69	13	But I pray to you, Lord , in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.
Psalms	69	14	Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.
Psalms	69	15	Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.

Psalms	69	17	Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.
Psalms	69	18	Come near and rescue me; deliver me because of my foes.
Psalms	69	19	You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.
Psalms	69	20	Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.
Psalms	69	21	They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.
Psalms	69	22	May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.
Psalms	69	23	May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.
Psalms	69	24	Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.
Psalms	69	25	May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
Psalms	69	26	For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
Psalms	69	27	Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.
Psalms	69	28	May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.
Psalms	69	29	But as for me, afflicted and in pain— may your salvation, God, protect me.
Psalms	69	30	I will praise God’s name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.
Psalms	69	31	This will please the Lord more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hooves.
Psalms	69	32	The poor will see and be glad— you who seek God, may your hearts live!
Psalms	69	33	The Lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.
Psalms	69	34	Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,
Psalms	69	35	for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;
Psalms	69	36	the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.
Psalms	7	1	Lord my God, I take refuge in you; save and deliver me from all who pursue me,
Psalms	7	2	or they will tear me apart like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
Psalms	7	3	Lord my God, if I have done this and there is guilt on my hands—
Psalms	7	4	if I have repaid my ally with evil or without cause have robbed my foe—
Psalms	7	5	then let my enemy pursue and overtake me; let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust.
Psalms	7	6	Arise, Lord , in your anger; rise up against the rage of my enemies. Awake, my God; decree justice.
Psalms	7	7	Let the assembled peoples gather around you, while you sit enthroned over them on high.
Psalms	7	8	Let the Lord judge the peoples. Vindicate me, Lord , according to my righteousness, according to my integrity, O Most High.
Psalms	7	9	Bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure— you, the righteous God who probes minds and hearts.
Psalms	7	10	My shield is God Most High, who saves the upright in heart.
Psalms	7	11	God is a righteous judge, a God who displays his wrath every day.
Psalms	7	12	If he does not relent, he will sharpen his sword; he will bend and string his bow.
Psalms	7	13	He has prepared his deadly weapons; he makes ready his flaming arrows.
Psalms	7	14	Whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment.
Psalms	7	15	Whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have made.
Psalms	7	16	The trouble they cause recoils on them; their violence comes down on their own heads.
Psalms	7	17	I will give thanks to the Lord because of his righteousness; I will sing the praises of the name of the Lord Most High.
Psalms	70	1	Hasten, O God, to save me; come quickly, Lord , to help me.
Psalms	70	2	May those who want to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
Psalms	70	3	May those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” turn back because of their shame.
Psalms	70	4	But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who long for your saving help always say, “The Lord is great!”
Psalms	70	5	But as for me, I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord , do not delay.
Psalms	71	1	In you, Lord , I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.
Psalms	71	2	In your righteousness, rescue me and deliver me; turn your ear to me and save me.
Psalms	71	3	Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
Psalms	71	4	Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of those who are evil and cruel.
Psalms	71	5	For you have been my hope, Sovereign Lord , my confidence since my youth.
Psalms	71	6	From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother’s womb. I will ever praise you.
Psalms	71	7	I have become a sign to many; you are my strong refuge.
Psalms	71	8	My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.
Psalms	71	9	Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
Psalms	71	10	For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.
Psalms	71	11	They say, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.”
Psalms	71	12	Do not be far from me, my God; come quickly, God, to help me.
Psalms	71	13	May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
Psalms	71	14	As for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.
Psalms	71	15	My mouth will tell of your righteous deeds, of your saving acts all day long— though I know not how to relate them all.
Psalms	71	16	I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, Sovereign Lord ; I will proclaim your righteous deeds, yours alone.
Psalms	71	17	Since my youth, God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
Psalms	71	18	Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, my God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your mighty acts to all who are to come.
Psalms	71	19	Your righteousness, God, reaches to the heavens, you who have done great things. Who is like you, God?
Psalms	71	20	Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.
Psalms	71	21	You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.
Psalms	71	22	I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	71	23	My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you— I whom you have delivered.
Psalms	71	24	My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
Psalms	72	1	Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.
Psalms	72	2	May he judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.
Psalms	72	3	May the mountains bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.
Psalms	72	4	May he defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; may he crush the oppressor.
Psalms	72	5	May he endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.
Psalms	72	6	May he be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.
Psalms	72	7	In his days may the righteous flourish and prosperity abound till the moon is no more.
Psalms	72	8	May he rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
Psalms	72	9	May the desert tribes bow before him and his enemies lick the dust.
Psalms	72	10	May the kings of Tarshish and of distant shores bring tribute to him. May the kings of Sheba and Seba present him gifts.
Psalms	72	11	May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.
Psalms	72	12	For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.
Psalms	72	13	He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.
Psalms	72	14	He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.
Psalms	72	15	Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.
Psalms	72	16	May grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. May the crops flourish like Lebanon and thrive like the grass of the field.
Psalms	72	17	May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. Then all nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.
Psalms	72	18	Praise be to the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
Psalms	72	19	Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
Psalms	72	20	This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
Psalms	73	1	Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
Psalms	73	2	But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.
Psalms	73	3	For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
Psalms	73	4	They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.
Psalms	73	5	They are free from common human burdens; they are not plagued by human ills.
Psalms	73	6	Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.
Psalms	73	7	From their callous hearts comes iniquity ; their evil imaginations have no limits.
Psalms	73	8	They scoff, and speak with malice; with arrogance they threaten oppression.
Psalms	73	9	Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.
Psalms	73	10	Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
Psalms	73	11	They say, “How would God know? Does the Most High know anything?”
Psalms	73	12	This is what the wicked are like— always free of care, they go on amassing wealth.
Psalms	73	13	Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and have washed my hands in innocence.
Psalms	73	14	All day long I have been afflicted, and every morning brings new punishments.
Psalms	73	15	If I had spoken out like that, I would have betrayed your children.
Psalms	73	16	When I tried to understand all this, it troubled me deeply
Psalms	73	17	till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.
Psalms	73	18	Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
Psalms	73	19	How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
Psalms	73	20	They are like a dream when one awakes; when you arise, Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.
Psalms	73	21	When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,
Psalms	73	22	I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.
Psalms	73	23	Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
Psalms	73	24	You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.
Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
Psalms	73	26	My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
Psalms	73	27	Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
Psalms	73	28	But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign Lord my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.
Psalms	74	1	O God, why have you rejected us forever? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
Psalms	74	2	Remember the nation you purchased long ago, the people of your inheritance, whom you redeemed— Mount Zion, where you dwelt.
Psalms	74	3	Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
Psalms	74	4	Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.
Psalms	74	5	They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.
Psalms	74	6	They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.
Psalms	74	7	They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
Psalms	74	8	They said in their hearts, “We will crush them completely!” They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
Psalms	74	9	We are given no signs from God; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.
Psalms	74	10	How long will the enemy mock you, God? Will the foe revile your name forever?
Psalms	74	11	Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!
Psalms	74	12	But God is my King from long ago; he brings salvation on the earth.
Psalms	74	13	It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
Psalms	74	14	It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave it as food to the creatures of the desert.
Psalms	74	15	It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever-flowing rivers.
Psalms	74	16	The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.
Psalms	74	17	It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.
Psalms	74	18	Remember how the enemy has mocked you, Lord , how foolish people have reviled your name.
Psalms	74	19	Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
Psalms	74	20	Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
Psalms	74	21	Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.
Psalms	74	22	Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.
Psalms	74	23	Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.
Psalms	75	1	We praise you, God, we praise you, for your Name is near; people tell of your wonderful deeds.
Psalms	75	2	You say, “I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge with equity.
Psalms	75	3	When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm.
Psalms	75	4	To the arrogant I say, ‘Boast no more,’ and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horns.
Psalms	75	5	Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak so defiantly.’ ”
Psalms	75	6	No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt themselves.
Psalms	75	7	It is God who judges: He brings one down, he exalts another.
Psalms	75	8	In the hand of the Lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
Psalms	75	9	As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob,
Psalms	75	10	who says, “I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
Psalms	76	1	God is renowned in Judah; in Israel his name is great.
Psalms	76	2	His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
Psalms	76	3	There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war.
Psalms	76	4	You are radiant with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.
Psalms	76	5	The valiant lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.
Psalms	76	6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.
Psalms	76	7	It is you alone who are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?
Psalms	76	8	From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet—
Psalms	76	9	when you, God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land.
Psalms	76	10	Surely your wrath against mankind brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
Psalms	76	11	Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.
Psalms	76	12	He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
Psalms	77	1	I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.
Psalms	77	2	When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands, and I would not be comforted.
Psalms	77	3	I remembered you, God, and I groaned; I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.
Psalms	77	4	You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.
Psalms	77	5	I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;
Psalms	77	6	I remembered my songs in the night. My heart meditated and my spirit asked:
Psalms	77	7	“Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?
Psalms	77	8	Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?
Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?”
Psalms	77	10	Then I thought, “To this I will appeal: the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.
Psalms	77	11	I will remember the deeds of the Lord ; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
Psalms	77	12	I will consider all your works and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”
Psalms	77	13	Your ways, God, are holy. What god is as great as our God?
Psalms	77	14	You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.
Psalms	77	15	With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
Psalms	77	16	The waters saw you, God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.
Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured down water, the heavens resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.
Psalms	77	18	Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
Psalms	77	19	Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.
Psalms	77	20	You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
Psalms	78	1	My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.
Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—
Psalms	78	3	things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us.
Psalms	78	4	We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord , his power, and the wonders he has done.
Psalms	78	5	He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children,
Psalms	78	6	so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.
Psalms	78	7	Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
Psalms	78	8	They would not be like their ancestors— a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.
Psalms	78	9	The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;
Psalms	78	10	they did not keep God’s covenant and refused to live by his law.
Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.
Psalms	78	12	He did miracles in the sight of their ancestors in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
Psalms	78	13	He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand up like a wall.
Psalms	78	14	He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.
Psalms	78	15	He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
Psalms	78	16	he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.
Psalms	78	17	But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.
Psalms	78	18	They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.
Psalms	78	19	They spoke against God; they said, “Can God really spread a table in the wilderness?
Psalms	78	20	True, he struck the rock, and water gushed out, streams flowed abundantly, but can he also give us bread? Can he supply meat for his people?”
Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard them, he was furious; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
Psalms	78	22	for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
Psalms	78	23	Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
Psalms	78	24	he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
Psalms	78	25	Human beings ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
Psalms	78	26	He let loose the east wind from the heavens and by his power made the south wind blow.
Psalms	78	27	He rained meat down on them like dust, birds like sand on the seashore.
Psalms	78	28	He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.
Psalms	78	29	They ate till they were gorged— he had given them what they craved.
Psalms	78	30	But before they turned from what they craved, even while the food was still in their mouths,
Psalms	78	31	God’s anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.
Psalms	78	32	In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
Psalms	78	33	So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.
Psalms	78	34	Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.
Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
Psalms	78	36	But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;
Psalms	78	37	their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
Psalms	78	38	Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
Psalms	78	40	How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the wasteland!
Psalms	78	41	Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	78	42	They did not remember his power— the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
Psalms	78	43	the day he displayed his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
Psalms	78	44	He turned their river into blood; they could not drink from their streams.
Psalms	78	45	He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
Psalms	78	46	He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
Psalms	78	48	He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
Psalms	78	49	He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility— a band of destroying angels.
Psalms	78	50	He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.
Psalms	78	51	He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
Psalms	78	52	But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the wilderness.
Psalms	78	53	He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
Psalms	78	54	And so he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
Psalms	78	55	He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
Psalms	78	56	But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
Psalms	78	57	Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
Psalms	78	58	They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
Psalms	78	59	When God heard them, he was furious; he rejected Israel completely.
Psalms	78	60	He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among humans.
Psalms	78	61	He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
Psalms	78	62	He gave his people over to the sword; he was furious with his inheritance.
Psalms	78	63	Fire consumed their young men, and their young women had no wedding songs;
Psalms	78	64	their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep.
Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.
Psalms	78	66	He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame.
Psalms	78	67	Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
Psalms	78	68	but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.
Psalms	78	69	He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever.
Psalms	78	70	He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens;
Psalms	78	71	from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance.
Psalms	78	72	And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.
Psalms	79	1	O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple, they have reduced Jerusalem to rubble.
Psalms	79	2	They have left the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your own people for the animals of the wild.
Psalms	79	3	They have poured out blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury the dead.
Psalms	79	4	We are objects of contempt to our neighbors, of scorn and derision to those around us.
Psalms	79	5	How long, Lord ? Will you be angry forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
Psalms	79	6	Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not call on your name;
Psalms	79	7	for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his homeland.
Psalms	79	8	Do not hold against us the sins of past generations; may your mercy come quickly to meet us, for we are in desperate need.
Psalms	79	9	Help us, God our Savior, for the glory of your name; deliver us and forgive our sins for your name’s sake.
Psalms	79	10	Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?” Before our eyes, make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants.
Psalms	79	11	May the groans of the prisoners come before you; with your strong arm preserve those condemned to die.
Psalms	79	12	Pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the contempt they have hurled at you, Lord.
Psalms	79	13	Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you forever; from generation to generation we will proclaim your praise.
Psalms	8	1	Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory in the heavens.
Psalms	8	2	Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
Psalms	8	3	When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
Psalms	8	4	what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?
Psalms	8	5	You have made them a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor.
Psalms	8	6	You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their feet:
Psalms	8	7	all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild,
Psalms	8	8	the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
Psalms	8	9	Lord , our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
Psalms	80	1	Hear us, Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth
Psalms	80	2	before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh. Awaken your might; come and save us.
Psalms	80	3	Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
Psalms	80	4	How long, Lord God Almighty, will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people?
Psalms	80	5	You have fed them with the bread of tears; you have made them drink tears by the bowlful.
Psalms	80	6	You have made us an object of derision to our neighbors, and our enemies mock us.
Psalms	80	7	Restore us, God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
Psalms	80	8	You transplanted a vine from Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it.
Psalms	80	9	You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.
Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches.
Psalms	80	11	Its branches reached as far as the Sea, its shoots as far as the River.
Psalms	80	12	Why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes?
Psalms	80	13	Boars from the forest ravage it, and insects from the fields feed on it.
Psalms	80	14	Return to us, God Almighty! Look down from heaven and see! Watch over this vine,
Psalms	80	15	the root your right hand has planted, the son you have raised up for yourself.
Psalms	80	16	Your vine is cut down, it is burned with fire; at your rebuke your people perish.
Psalms	80	17	Let your hand rest on the man at your right hand, the son of man you have raised up for yourself.
Psalms	80	18	Then we will not turn away from you; revive us, and we will call on your name.
Psalms	80	19	Restore us, Lord God Almighty; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved.
Psalms	81	1	Sing for joy to God our strength; shout aloud to the God of Jacob!
Psalms	81	2	Begin the music, strike the timbrel, play the melodious harp and lyre.
Psalms	81	3	Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and when the moon is full, on the day of our festival;
Psalms	81	4	this is a decree for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
Psalms	81	5	When God went out against Egypt, he established it as a statute for Joseph. I heard an unknown voice say:
Psalms	81	6	“I removed the burden from their shoulders; their hands were set free from the basket.
Psalms	81	7	In your distress you called and I rescued you, I answered you out of a thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
Psalms	81	8	Hear me, my people, and I will warn you— if you would only listen to me, Israel!
Psalms	81	9	You shall have no foreign god among you; you shall not worship any god other than me.
Psalms	81	10	I am the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth and I will fill it.
Psalms	81	11	“But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not submit to me.
Psalms	81	12	So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.
Psalms	81	13	“If my people would only listen to me, if Israel would only follow my ways,
Psalms	81	14	how quickly I would subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes!
Psalms	81	15	Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him, and their punishment would last forever.
Psalms	81	16	But you would be fed with the finest of wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
Psalms	82	1	God presides in the great assembly; he renders judgment among the “gods”:
Psalms	82	2	“How long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked?
Psalms	82	3	Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
Psalms	82	4	Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.
Psalms	82	5	“The ‘gods’ know nothing, they understand nothing. They walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
Psalms	82	6	“I said, ‘You are “gods”; you are all sons of the Most High.’
Psalms	82	7	But you will die like mere mortals; you will fall like every other ruler.”
Psalms	82	8	Rise up, O God, judge the earth, for all the nations are your inheritance.
Psalms	83	1	O God, do not remain silent; do not turn a deaf ear, do not stand aloof, O God.
Psalms	83	2	See how your enemies growl, how your foes rear their heads.
Psalms	83	3	With cunning they conspire against your people; they plot against those you cherish.
Psalms	83	4	“Come,” they say, “let us destroy them as a nation, so that Israel’s name is remembered no more.”
Psalms	83	5	With one mind they plot together; they form an alliance against you—
Psalms	83	6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,
Psalms	83	7	Byblos, Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the people of Tyre.
Psalms	83	8	Even Assyria has joined them to reinforce Lot’s descendants.
Psalms	83	9	Do to them as you did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon,
Psalms	83	10	who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.
Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
Psalms	83	12	who said, “Let us take possession of the pasturelands of God.”
Psalms	83	13	Make them like tumbleweed, my God, like chaff before the wind.
Psalms	83	14	As fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze,
Psalms	83	15	so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm.
Psalms	83	16	Cover their faces with shame, Lord , so that they will seek your name.
Psalms	83	17	May they ever be ashamed and dismayed; may they perish in disgrace.
Psalms	83	18	Let them know that you, whose name is the Lord — that you alone are the Most High over all the earth.
Psalms	84	1	How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord Almighty!
Psalms	84	2	My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord ; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Psalms	84	3	Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young— a place near your altar, Lord Almighty, my King and my God.
Psalms	84	4	Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you.
Psalms	84	5	Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
Psalms	84	6	As they pass through the Valley of Baka, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools.
Psalms	84	7	They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion.
Psalms	84	8	Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty; listen to me, God of Jacob.
Psalms	84	9	Look on our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one.
Psalms	84	10	Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
Psalms	84	11	For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless.
Psalms	84	12	Lord Almighty, blessed is the one who trusts in you.
Psalms	85	1	You, Lord , showed favor to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
Psalms	85	2	You forgave the iniquity of your people and covered all their sins.
Psalms	85	3	You set aside all your wrath and turned from your fierce anger.
Psalms	85	4	Restore us again, God our Savior, and put away your displeasure toward us.
Psalms	85	5	Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger through all generations?
Psalms	85	6	Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
Psalms	85	7	Show us your unfailing love, Lord , and grant us your salvation.
Psalms	85	8	I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servants— but let them not turn to folly.
Psalms	85	9	Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that his glory may dwell in our land.
Psalms	85	10	Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each other.
Psalms	85	11	Faithfulness springs forth from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
Psalms	85	12	The Lord will indeed give what is good, and our land will yield its harvest.
Psalms	85	13	Righteousness goes before him and prepares the way for his steps.
Psalms	86	1	Hear me, Lord , and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Psalms	86	2	Guard my life, for I am faithful to you; save your servant who trusts in you. You are my God;
Psalms	86	3	have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
Psalms	86	4	Bring joy to your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in you.
Psalms	86	5	You, Lord, are forgiving and good, abounding in love to all who call to you.
Psalms	86	6	Hear my prayer, Lord ; listen to my cry for mercy.
Psalms	86	7	When I am in distress, I call to you, because you answer me.
Psalms	86	8	Among the gods there is none like you, Lord; no deeds can compare with yours.
Psalms	86	9	All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord; they will bring glory to your name.
Psalms	86	10	For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God.
Psalms	86	11	Teach me your way, Lord , that I may rely on your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.
Psalms	86	12	I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever.
Psalms	86	13	For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths, from the realm of the dead.
Psalms	86	14	Arrogant foes are attacking me, O God; ruthless people are trying to kill me— they have no regard for you.
Psalms	86	15	But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.
Psalms	86	16	Turn to me and have mercy on me; show your strength in behalf of your servant; save me, because I serve you just as my mother did.
Psalms	86	17	Give me a sign of your goodness, that my enemies may see it and be put to shame, for you, Lord , have helped me and comforted me.
Psalms	87	1	He has founded his city on the holy mountain.
Psalms	87	2	The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the other dwellings of Jacob.
Psalms	87	3	Glorious things are said of you, city of God:
Psalms	87	4	“I will record Rahab and Babylon among those who acknowledge me— Philistia too, and Tyre, along with Cush — and will say, ‘This one was born in Zion.’ ”
Psalms	87	5	Indeed, of Zion it will be said, “This one and that one were born in her, and the Most High himself will establish her.”
Psalms	87	6	The Lord will write in the register of the peoples: “This one was born in Zion.”
Psalms	87	7	As they make music they will sing, “All my fountains are in you.”
Psalms	88	1	Lord , you are the God who saves me; day and night I cry out to you.
Psalms	88	2	May my prayer come before you; turn your ear to my cry.
Psalms	88	3	I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death.
Psalms	88	4	I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am like one without strength.
Psalms	88	5	I am set apart with the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave, whom you remember no more, who are cut off from your care.
Psalms	88	6	You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
Psalms	88	7	Your wrath lies heavily on me; you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
Psalms	88	8	You have taken from me my closest friends and have made me repulsive to them. I am confined and cannot escape;
Psalms	88	9	my eyes are dim with grief. I call to you, Lord , every day; I spread out my hands to you.
Psalms	88	10	Do you show your wonders to the dead? Do their spirits rise up and praise you?
Psalms	88	11	Is your love declared in the grave, your faithfulness in Destruction ?
Psalms	88	12	Are your wonders known in the place of darkness, or your righteous deeds in the land of oblivion?
Psalms	88	13	But I cry to you for help, Lord ; in the morning my prayer comes before you.
Psalms	88	14	Why, Lord , do you reject me and hide your face from me?
Psalms	88	15	From my youth I have suffered and been close to death; I have borne your terrors and am in despair.
Psalms	88	16	Your wrath has swept over me; your terrors have destroyed me.
Psalms	88	17	All day long they surround me like a flood; they have completely engulfed me.
Psalms	88	18	You have taken from me friend and neighbor— darkness is my closest friend.
Psalms	89	1	I will sing of the Lord ’s great love forever; with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations.
Psalms	89	2	I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
Psalms	89	3	You said, “I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn to David my servant,
Psalms	89	4	‘I will establish your line forever and make your throne firm through all generations.’ ”
Psalms	89	5	The heavens praise your wonders, Lord , your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.
Psalms	89	6	For who in the skies above can compare with the Lord ? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?
Psalms	89	7	In the council of the holy ones God is greatly feared; he is more awesome than all who surround him.
Psalms	89	8	Who is like you, Lord God Almighty? You, Lord , are mighty, and your faithfulness surrounds you.
Psalms	89	9	You rule over the surging sea; when its waves mount up, you still them.
Psalms	89	10	You crushed Rahab like one of the slain; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies.
Psalms	89	11	The heavens are yours, and yours also the earth; you founded the world and all that is in it.
Psalms	89	12	You created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon sing for joy at your name.
Psalms	89	13	Your arm is endowed with power; your hand is strong, your right hand exalted.
Psalms	89	14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you.
Psalms	89	15	Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you, who walk in the light of your presence, Lord .
Psalms	89	16	They rejoice in your name all day long; they celebrate your righteousness.
Psalms	89	17	For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.
Psalms	89	18	Indeed, our shield belongs to the Lord , our king to the Holy One of Israel.
Psalms	89	19	Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful people you said: “I have bestowed strength on a warrior; I have raised up a young man from among the people.
Psalms	89	20	I have found David my servant; with my sacred oil I have anointed him.
Psalms	89	21	My hand will sustain him; surely my arm will strengthen him.
Psalms	89	22	The enemy will not get the better of him; the wicked will not oppress him.
Psalms	89	23	I will crush his foes before him and strike down his adversaries.
Psalms	89	24	My faithful love will be with him, and through my name his horn will be exalted.
Psalms	89	25	I will set his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers.
Psalms	89	26	He will call out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, the Rock my Savior.’
Psalms	89	27	And I will appoint him to be my firstborn, the most exalted of the kings of the earth.
Psalms	89	28	I will maintain my love to him forever, and my covenant with him will never fail.
Psalms	89	29	I will establish his line forever, his throne as long as the heavens endure.
Psalms	89	30	“If his sons forsake my law and do not follow my statutes,
Psalms	89	31	if they violate my decrees and fail to keep my commands,
Psalms	89	32	I will punish their sin with the rod, their iniquity with flogging;
Psalms	89	33	but I will not take my love from him, nor will I ever betray my faithfulness.
Psalms	89	34	I will not violate my covenant or alter what my lips have uttered.
Psalms	89	35	Once for all, I have sworn by my holiness— and I will not lie to David—
Psalms	89	36	that his line will continue forever and his throne endure before me like the sun;
Psalms	89	37	it will be established forever like the moon, the faithful witness in the sky.”
Psalms	89	38	But you have rejected, you have spurned, you have been very angry with your anointed one.
Psalms	89	39	You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.
Psalms	89	40	You have broken through all his walls and reduced his strongholds to ruins.
Psalms	89	41	All who pass by have plundered him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
Psalms	89	42	You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice.
Psalms	89	43	Indeed, you have turned back the edge of his sword and have not supported him in battle.
Psalms	89	44	You have put an end to his splendor and cast his throne to the ground.
Psalms	89	45	You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with a mantle of shame.
Psalms	89	46	How long, Lord ? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire?
Psalms	89	47	Remember how fleeting is my life. For what futility you have created all humanity!
Psalms	89	48	Who can live and not see death, or who can escape the power of the grave?
Psalms	89	49	Lord, where is your former great love, which in your faithfulness you swore to David?
Psalms	89	50	Remember, Lord, how your servant has been mocked, how I bear in my heart the taunts of all the nations,
Psalms	89	51	the taunts with which your enemies, Lord , have mocked, with which they have mocked every step of your anointed one.
Psalms	89	52	Praise be to the Lord forever! Amen and Amen.
Psalms	9	1	I will give thanks to you, Lord , with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.
Psalms	9	2	I will be glad and rejoice in you; I will sing the praises of your name, O Most High.
Psalms	9	3	My enemies turn back; they stumble and perish before you.
Psalms	9	4	For you have upheld my right and my cause, sitting enthroned as the righteous judge.
Psalms	9	5	You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
Psalms	9	6	Endless ruin has overtaken my enemies, you have uprooted their cities; even the memory of them has perished.
Psalms	9	7	The Lord reigns forever; he has established his throne for judgment.
Psalms	9	8	He rules the world in righteousness and judges the peoples with equity.
Psalms	9	9	The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
Psalms	9	10	Those who know your name trust in you, for you, Lord , have never forsaken those who seek you.
Psalms	9	11	Sing the praises of the Lord , enthroned in Zion; proclaim among the nations what he has done.
Psalms	9	12	For he who avenges blood remembers; he does not ignore the cries of the afflicted.
Psalms	9	13	Lord , see how my enemies persecute me! Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,
Psalms	9	14	that I may declare your praises in the gates of Daughter Zion, and there rejoice in your salvation.
Psalms	9	15	The nations have fallen into the pit they have dug; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
Psalms	9	16	The Lord is known by his acts of justice; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
Psalms	9	17	The wicked go down to the realm of the dead, all the nations that forget God.
Psalms	9	18	But God will never forget the needy; the hope of the afflicted will never perish.
Psalms	9	19	Arise, Lord , do not let mortals triumph; let the nations be judged in your presence.
Psalms	9	20	Strike them with terror, Lord ; let the nations know they are only mortal.
Psalms	90	1	Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations.
